13	1	2	2	There are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment. Fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are. Also,the procedure does not specify how much vinigar to pour for each container. A good procedure would have specified this
14	1	2	2	In order the replicate the experiment you need
15	1	0	0	Well what i understand about this procedure is that you take four samples, put them in different containers that look the same, put vinegar on every sample + finally rinse them out with normal water + let them sit for 30 minutes till they dry. Then your finally going to see the difference between those samples.
16	1	0	0	I don't know what is going on!
17	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the shape of each material, because the amount of surface area expand to the vinegar mass, changes the results. I would also need to know how much vinegar and what size containers to use in order to exactly replicate the experiment.
18	1	0	0	The additional information I would need is to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain. After that I will have to come up with my dependent and independent variables so I can tell and see each one is different in mass. I will organize the data to see if the information is accurate. Then I will write the conclusion to see if my hypothesis was correct and to see if my results were correct.

31	1	2	2	I additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is to add where your going to leave the samples for 24 hours. Another one that they would need to add in order for me to replicate the experiment is to clearly state the independent variable. I would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each seperate but identical, container.
32	1	0	0	You will need a timer to determine the time that the vinegar dryed up.
33	1	3	3	For this experiment, you would actually need to know what each ''sample'' is, the amount of vinegar that was used and the size of each ''sample''
34	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment I would need to know the samples that I will be using. I would also need to know how much vinegar to use. I would also need to know what type of containers to use.

37	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of each material is used before i go and find the mass. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material. Although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure.
38	1	0	0	I will need to know what's the purpose for this experiment, know the difference in mass for each sample, and I need to know an esimate of what they thought the starting and ending mass was.
39	1	1	1	They should add how much vinegar to add to each sample. For this lab to be more accurate they should have also added more trials as well as adding a constant variable such as a rock in just water.
40	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know, first how to calculate the mass of the samples. I would also need t o know what the four samples are, as if is not stated in the procedure. Lastly to repeat this expirement I would need to know how much vinegar was placed into each container.
41	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate the data would be what equipment is needed for the experiment,what materials are going to be used,and how much of each material will be used?
42	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment:you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in the container. You also need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in. Also, you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water.
43	1	3	3	After reading the procedure i would  first need to know what the for sample are that i am testing second i ^p would need to know how much vinegar put in each container next the procedure should tell me how thing to case rinse each sample in distiled water.
44	1	3	3	Determine what the different samples are, then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample. State how long you are rising the materials in water. (ex 5 minutes)
45	1	2	2	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need a lot of additional information. First of all, I would need to know what it is that they are using as the four samples (rocks bark)
46	1	0	0	I think the experiment should make the description more specific so as not to be confused and mistake cups.For instance , they could say "each of the cork samples", and "place sample  into cup labeled 'A'"
47	1	2	2	One extra thing that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are of another thing not included is the amount of vinegar needed to put in each containers. The words "A sample" doesn't specify the exact amount of each rock are needed. A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results.
48	1	0	0	There could be more than 1 test for each sample. There could also have a constant added to the expariement. Also, there are to softy instanchings in the experiment like put on goggles before eyes where gloves when touching the vinegar
49	1	0	0	They should take more notes, that way, in case they mess up, they can have a the information how to redo it.
51	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the different mauterials were. I would also need to know how many different materials there were and what the starting mass of each material was.
52	1	0	0	In the experiment  I would determine the mas of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container then label. I would wait 24 hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water. Let the samples dry and find the mass difference
53	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment, three aditional thing should be included. The first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup. The second is to list the far samples in the procedure. The third is to record the information obtained.
54	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four and how long  containers, how much the sample you need to add you need to rinse the samples.
55	1	2	2	The procedure needs to state the four types of samples it is using, (marbles, limestone, wood, plastic). You need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup. You need a set amount. You could also do the time at different times. So you could do it at is at 30 and at 45 minutes to see if there is a change at all in the mass over time.
57	1	0	0	To repeat this experiment you would need to get the average that was used in the last procedure and let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass.
58	1	2	2	We need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container, to make sure that each sample fair results. We also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable. We also need to know what kind and how big the containers are, because results may be unreliable if the containers for the samples have all different volumes and shapes.
59	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in. Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material. We need to know how big the sample would have to be. Something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in, is it room temperature, we need to know this.
60	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, the procedure would require more detail. One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment. It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours. Finally, the procedure needs to include details about the experiment, for example if the whole sample must be submerged.
61	1	1	1	You would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps. That because the experiment only tell you to "pour vinegar" but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put.
62	1	3	3	This group left same very important thing out of their procedure. First of all they didn't tell us what sumples to use for the experiment. They didn't tell us how much vinegar to use or what size containers we would need all of this information to replicate this lab.
63	1	1	1	You would need the name of the four samples you are using to make a table to record data. Write down you need to record the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
64	1	0	0	Some additional information i would need is how they found the mass and what type of instrument was being used. Also when they say place a sample of the material, how much of each type am i going to need.
65	1	0	0	First of all you'll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples so you don't accidently have extra weight. Calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them. Use the same weight of each sample.
66	1	0	0	To exactly replicate this experiment you would have to know, how they measured the mass of the object, because without that how would we figure out the different masses. We have to know the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass.
67	1	1	1	After reading the group' procedure I did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the containers. This group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar. This group also did not state the reason the data, they just said to determine it.
68	1	2	2	I would need the amount of roch in each container. I would need the amount of vinegar of r container. I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container. I would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant.  I would also need the amount trials done.
69	1	3	3	1.A list of materials and safety requirements. ^p 2.The amount of vinegar to put in the containers. ^p 3.The temperature of the room/vineger ^p 4.A control group.
70	1	1	1	Additional information you need in order to replicate this experiment is a control group. A control grap  should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources. Also in order to replicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample. We also would need to know.
71	1	1	1	What you would need is the imformation on how much vinegar is added to every sample. For example, one sample can be in a different amount of vinegar. So that can throw their ending masses off.
72	1	2	2	We would need to know what samples they used for the experiment they just say "samples". We need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup and we would need to know what units to measure the mass of the samples with. They would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams.
73	1	0	0	What the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples. So what I would do : what they did in the beginning or the investigation I would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples.
74	1	1	1	On statement 2, They need to put the measurement of the containers ^p On statmen 4 how much water? ^p On number 6 whats the measuremt were suppost to use for the mass.
75	1	1	1	Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass.
76	1	3	3	In order to replicate ta experiment, a person would need to know a few more things. They would need to know which substances to use & how much of each one. The person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container. They would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in. One might also want to know what type of container, how to write down the findings.
77	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container. What type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment.
78	1	0	0	Additional pieces of information that shuld be included in the procedure would be, with with what would you be using to determine the mass such as a scale, have the controlled variable evident in the procedure, one last thing that should be to move a table of the starting mass, the endingmass, and the difference in mass using grams.
79	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured into each container. You would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples. Also, you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same.
80	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment,I would need to know 3 more things that weren't stated in the procedure. I would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container,the amount of time the samples were in the vinegar and the amount of distilled water used to rinse it off.
81	1	3	3	The additional things that I would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in. I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment. Lastly, I would also put in my procedure, how much  amount of vinegar they are putting in.
82	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you must be able to know what the four materials are, how to measure the mass, how much vinegar should be poured into the containers and how much distilled water should they rinse it with. They should start by saying, d determine the mass(put the tripple beam balance), of the four diff. samples(name them), then pour vinegar(how much) into containers, then these step of step 4, wash( how much distilled water, and it would be better.
83	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the size of the containers that you would place the sample in, you would need to know the amount of vinegar putting in each container, you would need to know what to use to measure out the mass (for example, tripple beam balance, etc) and you would also need to know the material to use to place each sample in the containers.
84	1	0	0	You got to put more Vinegar in wood so it make no different in mass in plastic out a little not more Vinegar so it could do more reaction.
85	1	1	1	Another trials, the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure it's accurate. Because if not youill change the experiment. By changing the most important things.
86	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure. First, we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers, enough to cover them? Next, we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, we need to know which materials to use. The data indicates them, but the procedure does not.
87	1	0	0	Three additional pieces of information  I would need to replicate the procedure are to gather materials, use a control, and when it's finish to record the data.
88	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know several more piecesof information. One of them being the amount of each material (wood, plastic, marble and limestone). You would also need to know how much vinegar to add. Finally, a constant for each material would alsohelp.
89	1	0	0	The independent varriable is the imarble, limestone wood, plastic.The marble starting point was 9.8g. The limestone was 10.4g and wood starting point 11.2.The end of the exeperiment is that you have to determine the mass of each sample.
90	1	2	2	Additional information that could be useful in order to replicate the experiment would be to list the actual samples in the procedure so you can see what your using. Secondly, in the procedures I nade need to what to weigh the mass in, for example, they didn't tell you to weigh in grams and I wouldn't be able to complete the experiment easily. It doesn't tell how much vinegar to actually pour into each container in order to replicate, I would need to know that.
91	1	3	3	I think that knowing the temperature in the envoment would be very useful, I'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples, we wouldn't get the same results. Also, we need to know what type of environment we should place this in. Should it be sunny, dark, windy, hot, cold, etc. I also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be, we don't even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples. This experiment is missing too much information.
92	1	0	0	In order for I for  replicate this expirement I woukd need to know what are the reaserching with this expirement what kind of result are  being booked at and the mass of each sample at the end of expirment  theie results.
93	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water. You would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment, and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in.
96	1	0	0	In order to replicate this groups procedure, you would need to know the independent and dependent variables as well as the control group for the procedure. Also, to ma ke it more clear, they would need to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose.
97	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure would have to add more details. In the first bullet, the four samples should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need. There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment. Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added. One last thing, is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say,in grams.
98	1	1	1	They should have told the samples that was used. The second thing was the outcome, what happened to the differ.
99	1	3	3	The students need to say what  the samples are. They need to
100	1	2	2	The group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control. Also they should have compared at least one more trial material before reply 2conclusion.The recommended sizes of the samples should have also been stated in order for the conclusion to be easy to compare with other group attempting to complete this experiment.
101	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples. In step 2 I would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container. Also in step 4 I would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long.
102	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, some additional information I would need is how the grap determined the mass of the samples and what did they use to do so. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar they used to pour in each container as well as what kind of containers they used.
103	1	1	1	First off these groups of students forgot to addd in step 2 how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container. In step number 5 the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different (marble, limestone, wood, plastic). The students also forgot to include step 7, which is find the differences in mass. If another group of students were going to do this exact experiment they wouldn't know what they are comparing.
104	1	2	2	If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp. of the room, i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used.
106	1	1	1	The additional information that is needed it the amount of vinegar being poured into each cut. Also you need to record all the information. They need to know how much water they are putting into the containers after 24 hours.
108	1	3	3	In addition to the information given, you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container,different amounts could change the results. There should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at, because change in temperature can affect the corossion process. In the experiment, it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size.
109	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the measur ments of the liquids poured into the cups. Also wat size cups are the liquids poured into. In the procedure it says "pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers". That is the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment.
110	1	0	0	Some additional information they could have added was they they should have weighed the sample before they put 4 in the vinegar.
111	1	0	0	For each box, they should have done it 3 times so they would have an average.
112	1	1	1	I would need to know what materials i am getting to begin this experiment. What should i be looking for when experiment is going on? How do i determine the mas of each sement.
113	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the proceeduce include, what type of samples your using, also do explain why you are using vinegar. Finally, to tell the reader what your weighing with and why.
114	1	2	2	If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the size of the containers, and what was used to weigh the samples.
115	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you should know how much of each sample you were supposed to start with, what you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how the containers were kept room temperature outside etc.
116	1	0	0	In order to replicate this this experiment youwould need the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
118	1	0	0	Your going to need how much is there in total.
119	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers.^p Place one sample in a conteiner and do the same for the rest, ^p After 24 hrs remove sample and rinse ^p Sit and drt for 30 min. ^p determine the mles.
121	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared, I would also be more specific on the word "samples" to describe rocks and stones. And most importantly I would make a control, I would put marble, limestone, wood and plastic in water.
122	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need some additional information. First of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container. Second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar.
124	1	1	1	You would need what semples there, what you do after number 6.
125	1	0	0	It would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data. Also a total of the data could have been better too.
126	1	3	3	First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
127	1	0	0	The additional information I would need to radicate the experiment I would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. I would put "After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container & rinse each sample w/ distilled water. "Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. Instead of putting "Determine the mass of each sample". I would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out.
128	1	0	0	I will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are. The sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight.
129	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a control would need to be established. Also, a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment. In order to accurately replicate this experiment, it would help to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours.
130	1	3	3	We would word correct safety measures to take,the control,the effect of vinegar,what temperature to store them at,what the identical containers are made of and its size,what type of scale to use to meas it,the amount of vinegar in each container,i more trials
131	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, there are a few more things I need to know. The problem does not state what the four different samples are. Second, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. The amount of vinegar could impact the mass. Last, I would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period. Different tempuratures might affect the different samples.
132	1	2	2	this question would need to include the measurement of the containers & the amount of vinegar poured in each cup.
133	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know what she containers to use and how to measure the mass of the samples. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container.
134	1	0	0	You would need to know the portions of what they used as not to ruin the experiment, or not usin enough or too much may not give you the same results.
135	1	3	3	In order to replicate the lab, the students did you would need to know what materials were need. What kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples.
138	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical. U also need to know tha amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group of students recieved from the samples. Another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the oud example of the experiment. Another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight.
139	1	3	3	Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using?
140	1	2	2	The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used. They should also say how much water they should use when they are distilling the sample and they also need to say how much vinegar they are pouring into each labeled cup.
141	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information that I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are of, how much vinegar to pour into each container, and what exactly the purpose or problem statement for this experiment was.  Also, how much distilled water I would need to use.
142	1	2	2	In the procedure, i would also need to know how much vinegar to use, which scale of measure they are using and how big each container is.
144	1	3	3	To replicate this  experiment you would also need to know vinergar they used, the size of the cup and the the size of the samples.
145	1	2	2	After reading the procedure there were a few things I need to know to replicate the experiment. One thing is the amount of vinegar used. Another is How much water to use when rinsing it. The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours. There were a few problems with this procedure.
146	1	3	3	I would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the containers be covered or not? It would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into.
147	1	1	1	I need to know how big the container is & how many of them.
148	1	2	2	What are the samples/what is the material use how much vinegar is poored in the containers.
149	1	0	0	The students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen. Also they should have stated what they were investigating. They should have made a conclusion from the results.
150	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what tools to use such as safety goggles, and having more trials.
151	1	1	1	They needed to add what the samples were how the mass should be determined,they need to tell you to table the containers, and you need to record tour data.
153	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup, the temperature of the surroundings, and the exact acidity of the vinegar on the ph scale.
154	1	0	0	To replicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid.
156	1	0	0	Some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar. Also, maybe not have then sit for 24 hours, but hav then sit less. They could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water.
157	1	2	2	The additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are: ^p 1.)The amount of vinegar to pour - this must remain constant in a credible experiment. ^p 2.)The types of samples used should be in the procedure. ^p 3.)
158	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to find out how much vinegar to pour into the containers. We know that marble lost 4 grams, limestone lost 1.3 grams, plastic lost 1 grams and wood stayed the same, but we need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample.
159	1	0	0	We had all the information we need to do the experiment, we allready know that wood is the one that has more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able to complete the mass, because it looks like they only have estimates for the mass.
160	1	2	2	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the difference in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment. You'd also need to know what all the samples were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each container.
161	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much of one sample material do they want, and how they want us to determine the mass.
162	1	1	1	There are a couple additions that should be made to replicate the lab accurately. In procedure 1, it does not say to measure the mass of the samples wi or without a petri dish. It also should say that they should be measured with a particular instrument, such as balance beam. Another part that was left out was that they forgot to tell how much vinegar the four samples need, because if one gets more than another, it might change the weight and how much water torince the samples with.
163	1	1	1	You would need to tel what type of samples they are. Also, what type of untensil to use to measure the mass of the samples. Also, would need repeat or replicating trials to re-test the experiment. Or you ll also need to tell what to label the containers by in this experiment, you 'll also need to reach the mass or how each sample looks by using your five senses, or whatever or not to make a data same to show your results.
164	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what kind of ''samples'' I am using. The group states to determine the mass of four samples but does not tell me what kind of material these samples are. Also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample I should measure. Again this groups procedure is very being detail and it would help to make the experiment as accurate as possible, to know how much of the sample I should be using. Finally in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar I should add to each sample. Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently, making the experiment inaccurate.
165	1	2	2	In order to be able to duplicate this experiment, you need the following information: How much vinegar to use. Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume. And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers.
166	1	1	1	Additional information I would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample. This is because, if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways: for example if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would.
167	1	0	0	In order to deplicate this experiment, you would need to state exectly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour. In most cases, it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be difficient.
168	1	3	3	To repeat this experiment, I would need to know the four different  samples without knowing that I don't know what I'm testing. I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups. I would need to know where to put all of the different containers. I don't know if they need to stay at room temp, cold or not.
169	1	0	0	You should repeat each step in the experiment. Start with step 1 and go all the way to step 6.
170	1	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know when you started to know when to finish the experiment.
172	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure in order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the size of the containers because the smaller the container, the more densely packed the samples are. I would also need to know whether or not light and heat or dark and cold will affect the experiments.
174	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used (because I could have choosen metal, carbboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results. Also I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change. Lastly, they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room temp. or by a light source makes a difference too.
175	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, they would need to tell you how much vinnegar to put in the cups, have all the rocks way the same and tell us why they are doing the experiment.
176	1	2	2	To replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, how much distilled water needed to rinse the samples and the type of samples.
177	1	2	2	These students procedure was not  a reliable one. The material needed to mention what kind of material they uses. Is there only reducing to ism the "sample." They also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup. The material also that not  include in control groups. which is a centered post or any experiment. They student variable unchecked. They also included only the trial.
178	1	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar  added to each sample which have to be the same replicate the experiment.
180	1	1	1	The group needs to add what to label because
182	1	3	3	First, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers. You would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of. Lastly, they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun, in a dry, cold place etc.
183	1	2	2	-In step 1, we need to know what samples. It should list the 4 types of rock. ^p -In step 4, how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given. ^p -In step 6, it should say to correct the new mass of each sample.
184	1	1	1	The procedure is not clear, they need to say the sample names because we don't know what it is. Also, they need to say why to measure the mass of the four different samples before putting it in the vinegar. Finally, they should repeat the experiment a several times so to see the difference and maybe they should keep the sample in the container for a longer time to see the results.
185	1	0	0	We would need observations during the whole experiment , maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anythings changed. Also try another sample.
186	1	2	2	The experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure. For example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described. The method of determining the mass as well as the four sample materials, has not been specified in the procedural information.
187	1	1	1	1. I would have to know what kind of area I would have to leave it in for 24 hours. (temperature) ^p 2. I would have to know what kind of wood to use, if there has any specific. ^p 3. Also in step 6, it does not say what I have to use to determine the mass of the rocks, plastic and wood.
188	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the containers should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample.
189	1	0	0	In this group's procedure, some additional information should've been what were the labels named.
190	1	2	2	Additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar. You would also need to  know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use.
191	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment i belive that the information wanted would be the starting rows, ending mass, and difference in mass. The additional information in my opinion would be how the structure changed throughout the procedure.I f you were to record this data at because the procedure would be successful to see the difference on mass in four samples
192	1	0	0	I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
193	1	0	0	In the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone / rock / plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them. They could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one :marble, limestone, wood and plastic. In the procedure it only explained "After 24hrs" but they didn't write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time.
194	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure,i found 2 more additional pieces of informotins so that i can duplicate the experiments. I need to know the independent variable, dependent variadle and how much vinegar to pour into each seperate containers.
195	1	3	3	After reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were. Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample. The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be.
196	1	3	3	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample, in order to find the mass of only the sample, you need to subtract the mass of the container. Also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample. I also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when I am waiting 24 hours. Lastly, I need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react.
197	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the person performing it should do a few things differently. First, they should state what materials they are using, second, they should have a set  measurement  of how much vinegar to pour into each container, and third, they should state that you must find the difference of the starting and ending masses.
198	1	1	1	Need to know how much vinigar to put in each container, how you are going to get the mass of the sample and how they are going to calculate the difference should be included in the students procedure.
199	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used. you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water.  The size of the container would be essential as well, so you would know how much vinegar should be used.
200	1	0	0	Additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be for the group to explain how to determine the mass of the materials, to find out what the starting mass was, to explain more specifically how to place the materials in separate containers for less confusion, and to explain how you find the ending mass and the difference in mass.
201	1	0	0	You would need more marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
202	1	1	1	You would need the amount of vineger the samples sat in. The amount of water they where rinsed in, and the amount of each sample.
203	1	0	0	I don't know what replicate means, so I don't know how to anser this question
204	1	3	3	First, it doesn't tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers. Next, it doesn't say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, maybe they need a cover for it but we don't know from this information. In addition, there is an information about how they determined the mass.
205	1	2	2	In the group's procedure, three things need to do is tell how much vinegar should be poured in the containers, how much of a sample should be added and what conditions the containers were placed in for the 24 hours.
206	1	3	3	1. What kind of "sample of material" are you using. 2. How much vinegar should we put in the containers. 3. They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample.
207	1	2	2	I need to know how much vinegar. I need to pour on each of pour seperate, but dentical containers. I need to know what the four different samples are.
208	1	0	0	In order to replicate experiment Acid Rain'' you will need  get four seperate but identical containers, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container, After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container. After 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again.
209	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container.Also I would need to know of each sample was, are solid piece or,n  small or pieces. The greas would need to identify
210	1	1	1	They would have to add put each four different sample, in four separate, but identical containers in which you poured the vinegar. Butthey have to tell you the amount of vinegar to pour in all four identical containers.
211	1	3	3	The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment. There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off, decreasing the mass. The group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used: whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size.
212	1	0	0	Tools.
213	1	2	2	A desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment. The it would also be helpful to determine why this experiment was being performed, as well as knowing if the samples were covered or not, and how much vinegar to use.
214	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are. The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without. The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain. That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab. Also the lab should have said what type of container wether it is a beaker, test tube or a different type of container.
215	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to insure each sample has to same amount to react to. I would need to also know which type of container to use.
216	1	2	2	One piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure. They repeat over and over about different samples, but never once tell you what they were.The second piece of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting mass,ending mass and then the difference between the two for each sample. Finally the 3rd thing they should make known is how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measure is being used.
217	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do I leave the containers after I finish putting all the samples into different containers.
218	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed for the procedure would be how someone find the mass of the samples and using what to find the mass, what are the samples;marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how to find the different in mass.
219	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers, how ling to rinse each sample and with how much distilled water. I think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass, therefore ruining the experiment. Also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass. So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing.
221	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment, is how many ml of vinigars are poured to each four seperate containers? Not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled? And what are the four different samples? These are information's I need to replicate the procedure.
222	1	2	2	The first thing is why the students are doing this experiment. Then the second piece of infor mation is the amount of vinegar put in each container. The student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample. Finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials.
223	1	1	1	First they should of put the amount of vinegar being used. They don't say to record there data.
224	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following: ^p 1. Explain what the four different samples would be. ^p 2. Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup. ^p 3.Another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples. ^p 4. Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples.
225	1	0	0	I
226	1	1	1	In order to repeat this experiment i would need to get the sample materials that they used. In this experiment they used marble, limestone, wood, plastic. The second step is to find the mass of the four samples. Then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment. Thats how i would do this experiment over.
227	1	1	1	We would need to know what the investigation was, need to know what kined of "sample" their talking about. What they used to determine the mass. All of this information will help the reader help understaned the investigation better.
229	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar was used, how much distilled water was used and what kind of containers were used.
230	1	0	0	The students still need to make a hypothesis, a graph and find the difference in mass.
231	1	2	2	One piece of information I would need to know in order to replicate the group's procedure is how much of each sample did they put into each vinegar-filled container. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container. I would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples. If I used different amounts of water when washing the samples, one may not be as thoroughly washed as another which could mess up the results.
232	1	2	2	Some additional information we would need in order to replicate the experiment is, how much vinegar do we pour into the containers, how do we determine the mass of the four samples and how long do we rinse the samples with distilled water.
233	1	0	0	You need limestone and marble.
234	1	1	1	The information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area? What type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass?
235	1	0	0	In order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial. And also kep the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need ti have a TV and DV content.They also could or tabled their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease
236	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment  I need to know the materials, what kind of sample material, and why are they doing the experiment. How much vinegar rinse or how long
237	1	0	0	Determine the ending mass, determine the difference in mass. Also the mass or everything marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to add up all  three masses, starting, ending and the difference in mass, then you will get the answer to all of them.
239	1	3	3	The group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just saying '' different samples''. They also say determine the mass of that substances, but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass (scale).They need to  say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used. Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with, and how.
240	1	2	2	You would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples. Also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate. Finally, you would need to know how to measure the mass of the samples (what instrument to use).
241	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2. In step 4, a person would need to know the temperature the 4 'samples' are waiting 24 hours in. In step 3, the procedure states a sample of one material unless the 4 materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure, the actual names of each of the materials should be given. Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well.
242	1	2	2	I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container. What four types of materials we need for the experiment, to know that we need to find the difference between the masses of the materials before and after the experiment in order replicate the experiment.
243	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you will need amount of vinegar used, the size of the container and and the amount of time used for each step of the experiment. These are 3 three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment.
244	1	2	2	Some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in. Another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container. Another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it.
245	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples.
246	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample, the limestone sample and the wood sample, and the plastic sample. I would follow the procedure step by step.
247	1	1	1	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is a little to show what the students are experimenting. Including writing down the data in the experiment. Make step 3 to separate steps.Also how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass. Another thing to make the experiment better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each containers.
248	1	1	1	First you would need a control. The absence of what is effecting the dependant. in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it, so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar. This group had don't write down the amount of vinegar. its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment. They should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable.
249	1	2	2	There is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment. I need to know what the four starting samples are. Also, this procedure needs to include weigh the samples. I need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample. Lastly, at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight.
250	1	1	1	Three aditional peace of information you need is what typ of vinegar and at what PH. Also the lb of the samples.
252	1	3	3	They need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of samples to use and how much testing needs to be done after 24 hours.
253	1	1	1	what additional information that may be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar before the experiment, also the amount of vinegar after taking each sample out of the cup. However, including information about time wouldn't hart the econ't either.
254	1	3	3	1. Firstly, the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are, how big they are, what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment ^p 2. The group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container- how much is needed? ^p 3. The group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container. Even though this is just vinegar, their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab. Goggle inclusion would also be rise.
255	1	2	2	The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing. They need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format. The way of massing the sample should be clearer and should also explain that each sample should be massed sepparately.
256	1	3	3	Additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container. How long do you rinse the samples ? Do the samples stay outside or inside ? Day or night ?
257	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information, what are four samples? You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same. They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need. The last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container?
258	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers. Also I would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment. And finally, I need to know if it is weighed in grams, pounds or any other measurement.
259	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separate containers. You would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each container. The last thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the containers, and make sure its the same type of sample you used at any time.
260	1	2	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment the number of trials they did in order to do the experiment, the amount of vinegar to put in the containers, the different samples they used (needs to be stated in procedures), and the amount of the sample placed in the container.
261	1	0	0	You would need to add observations, you would also need to add the time on the table.
262	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers. You would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar. You will also need to have 4 containers and they have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container.
263	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass of it with the distilled water.
264	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment the group will have to start over again by determining the masses of the marble, limestone, wood and the plastic. Pour the vinegar into their containers. Place the materials into the containers and wait 24 hours. May be the mass will be differet may be it will be the same.
265	1	3	3	There is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment, first i would need to know what the four different samples are. Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers. Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use. Last, i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment.
266	1	1	1	The other information I would need to replicate this experiment is, what do we use for the samples? How much each "samples" do we use? and how do we determine the mass of each sample?
267	1	1	1	After reading this group's procedure, I found that they left out the amount of vinegar that was added to each cup. This information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated the results would vary among other replications from the original test, the data obtained from a replication of this experiment it would be false and the procedure couln't be replicated. Therefore, it is clear that the amount of vinegar poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment.
269	1	0	0	I guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht, like allow to Dry in 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers. 3 Go over to make sure nothing goes wrong.
270	1	3	3	The students need to include what the samples were. You can't do an experiment if you don't know what you're testing on. The students should also include the temp. that the containers were stored at for 24 hours. Lastly, they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container. They could've put the same amount or different amount. They could've put little or a lot.
274	1	1	1	If trying to replicate this experiment, you would need more information. You need to know how much vinegar to poor into the containers. You will also need to know what to label your container. How do you determine the mass of the samples when trying an experiment, you need  to make sure that you have all of the correct  information before starting your project.
275	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the materials your using. This procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the containers full of vinegar.
276	1	1	1	The students did not make it clear as to what materials they used as samples. They also didn't specify how much of each sample. They also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went.
277	1	2	2	Some additional information that's needed in order to replicate this experiment are the names (kinds) of each sample, the measurements of each sample poured into the containers, and the amount of vinegar poured into each container as well.
278	1	1	1	Some information that is missing that they don't say what size of containers, and they don't say what to do with data.
279	1	1	1	In order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used, and if it is the same for all of them. You would also need to do another trial, as the extra information would validate the experiment more.
280	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vineger is being poured in. I would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples. Lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container, weather or not all of it or half of it should be added.
281	1	3	3	To tell the amount vinger you pour into the container, the size of the container, Ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water. How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass.
282	1	1	1	This procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials. First it has to say to put on their eye protection. It also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples. Lastly, there needs to be a step on how to find the difference in the masses and to remind the reader to record their results.
283	1	0	0	1)Say what you are trying figure out in the first place. ^p 2)It's not enough into figure out what is going on. ^p 3)We need to know more clearly how to do each step.
285	1	1	1	In order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup. They also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed. If there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid.
286	1	2	2	They did not tell us what to measure with, they also did not tell us how much vinegar to put in or how big of containers.
288	1	0	0	Some information I would need to know is how would the water be if
289	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know more information. I would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen. Also, I don't know how much vinegar to pore in each cup. This procedure also should specify what materials to use, line what brand of cups or size.
290	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers. They also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample.
291	1	3	3	First they should list the samples they used. Marble, limestone, wood and plastic in their procedure. They should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect. They should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet, as a refrigerator, or somthing. Not just leaving it out of their processes.
292	1	0	0	in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each temp. by hour bic it's recorded after a 24 har period. You would also need to know the mass before it was left to ary for 30 mins.
293	1	1	1	To add to the experiment design, the group should keep the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables. Following this, you will
294	1	1	1	Additials information that would be good to now is, why are the students performing this xpirement? Why arent there cups a for measures for distiled water amounts, or vinegar amounts? You should also know why the starting mass for the materials all arent the same.
295	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar the group poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar I would get different results.
296	1	0	0	You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water. You will probably need more of a little bit of everything.
297	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass, which would be a triple beam balance. You would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step 3. You would also need to know what the 4 samples you are testing are. Those samples would be marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
298	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's experement, I would need the following information,  what  the 4 samples  are, how much vinegar to put into each containers and how much of each sample.
299	1	1	1	The information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be that firstly they need a hypothesis. Secondly, they need to list all objects they used, lastly they need to state weather their hypothesis was/wasn't correct.
300	1	1	1	The group of students should add a control to see the different between the samples and the control. In the experiment procedure also doesn't put the different samples of four like (marble, limestone, wood, plastic) The purpose of this experiment should be a group of student what is the different samples of the mass of flour after let them dry for a certain time.
301	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know the size of the containers, the amount of each material to start with, and the amount of vinegar used.
302	1	3	3	I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container. How long to rinse it in water (materials). And what kind of container casinial use.
304	1	1	1	To duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the brands of all the products on its accurate, the environment the experiment was in and what kind of scale was used so that the replicate experiment is  identical making it move accurate.
305	1	2	2	The additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the specific 4 different samples. I also need to know how much vinegar is needed. Furthermore, I need to know the amount of each sample needed. Finally, this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample.
306	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time.
307	1	2	2	Their are three things wrong with this procedure. One is, they did not table the four identical containers, the second is, they need to tell how much vinegar is needed. The third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water.
308	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment i would need to know what to do to the control. Also i would need to know how much vinegar needed to give into each separate containers. Lastly i would have mll of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed.
310	1	0	0	You will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container. After the 24 hours is over remove samples and rinse. Have the samples sit and dry for 30 min.
311	1	2	2	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different containers and what should they be labeled.
313	1	3	3	Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment. First is how much vinegar should be alloted to each individual cup, as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples. The next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples, though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not. Third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period. Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ? Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment.
314	1	1	1	This experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same.
315	1	0	0	The information the students left out was the control. The control of the expiriment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affacted the samples.
316	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to use and how much of each material to put into the vinegar. Also the experiment  doesn't  say how to remove the materials from the vinegar.
317	1	0	0	After reading this procedure i think it would need task needed. Tell what it is you are doing and what solution, and a hypothesis.
319	1	2	2	The additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are, tell how much vinegar was used in each container and how many remaining samples are going to be used.
321	1	2	2	You would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry.
322	1	3	3	The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample1,2,etc.). They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container.
323	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass. Also I need to know what should I do with the containers once I've labeled them. The experiment's results might change if we are supposed to cap the containers or heat them, you don't know what to do. Lastly, how much water should I rinse the samples with, if different amounts are used, the weight could differ.
324	1	2	2	If I a just looking  at the people and I was to repeta this experiment  I would need to know what the four different samples  were,  does the distilled water need to be a after temperature, and how much vinegar  do i add to the samples.
325	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use, how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use. The procedure is very vague. A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment. Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic. They should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used.
326	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the mass of 4 different samples should be held constant there should be a control group. The experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed, and if it was rinsed with cold, hot or warm water it should also include where the samples were kept and the temperature, they were kept at. Also what was the group  investigating in should be included.
327	1	3	3	How much vinegar you pour into the cups. What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use.
328	1	2	2	To make this procedure repeatable, we would first need to know the four samples we would be working with. Otherwise, we couldn't even start the experiment. We would also need to know how much Vinegar in ml to pour in the cups.
329	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need additonal information. For example, how much vinegar should be poured into each container? I would also want to know the size of each sample, and make sure the surface area of each is as close to equal as possible. Lastly, I would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. With this information I am certainly capable of repeating the experiment.
330	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring. All they tell us is vinegar. Also, what is the size of the containers? How much of each sample is being poured into the container? The group would need to tell us these facts so we can follow their steps to do the same experiment.
331	1	0	0	I think from reading the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after (see if there were any physical changes). If something was to change, then the group should've got it down so we know the features of the items.
332	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are acurate. They would also need to include the four samples names, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. So I know what everything what everything is so I can create a data table. They would also need to include in the procedure that when massing the substances, I would first need to zero the containers on the scale and then bar the sample in.
333	1	0	0	More information is needed, more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion. Not many materials are listed.
334	1	0	0	3 pieces of information I would include to replicate ths procedure would be to pour less vinegar in each container, let samples sit and dry for 30 min and leave samples for 20 hours. I choose that to see if anything different would happen to the mass then what happened to it the first time they tried this experiment.
335	1	1	1	I would still want to know what they were doing this experiment, how large were the samples and what was used to measure the work samples.
336	1	1	1	In order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each. Also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research.
337	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers, you should also know what the acidity of the vinegar is so  that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker PH level. You would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant.
338	1	0	0	The additional information you need to replace the experiment. You need limestone, wood and plastic, marbles. You test all of them in different containers. It will give you the mass of the experiment. That is what it need to replace the experiment.
339	1	0	0	How much of the material did they put into each container. Was there a controlled part of this experiment. Did they conduct a graph for this experiment.
340	1	1	1	I would say one piece of information they forgot was the amount of vinegar they put in each procedure.
341	1	3	3	In the procedure, it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample. Finally, additional information that should be added would be, telling where to keep these samples, where it's cold, room or hot temperature.
342	1	3	3	How much vinegar would you pour in each cup. What temperature would the samples be in,would it be the same or would it be different? how would also need to know if they used the same size cup. These things are all very important information that wasn't included.
344	1	3	3	Some additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar, size of the containers, and the temperature.
345	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known. Also, the type of container is not specified nor is the number of pieces of the samples that should be tested stated. All of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment.
346	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment more information is needed. For example, there has to be clear statement of problem. This procedure doesn't explain why they were finding out the mass of four different samples. Also there has to be information  on how much vinegar they put in each container that way we can replicate the experiment.
347	1	1	1	The additional information it would need would be the
348	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with. You will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what youcan know what you have to do.
349	1	2	2	Some information that could be added  could be temperature of the vinegar or water, you could also add  how much vinegar  you add, another thing to add would be a list of possible samples.
352	1	0	0	I believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
353	1	0	0	To replicate their experiment I would need to have take their their procedure and use them. I would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment. All these need are the true basic's.
354	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didn't receive the treatment and in this case didn't receive the vinegar, needs to be more clear. It says pour vinegar into a container but it's not specific as to how much vinegar. Also how much of the sample that will be used isn't stated.
355	1	2	2	In order to replicate this expiriment, you would need to know, how much vinegar you should distribute into the container, how long you should run thewater on it for rinsing, how much of the each material you need.
356	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know what the material (samples) were, (marble,limestone,acid and plastic). You would also need to know the amount of vinegar that was placed in the cup and you would need to know what you are weighing the mass in which is grams. If these three were added to the procedure,then you could replicate the experiment.
357	1	1	1	To replicate the expirement I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample.
358	1	0	0	To me I think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working.
359	1	3	3	I would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as (ml). Where do I put the cups in the sun or refridarter, where do I let the samples dry in the open or the outside.
360	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples, then pour vinegar in a container and after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each with distilled water. In order to replicate this experiment, I would have to know how much vinegar should be added to each container with the samples.
361	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container, how much distilled water each sample was washed with, and the size of the containers.
362	1	3	3	After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure,how much vinegar should I pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended ,what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, ending It RIGHT   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used.
363	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container. It would also put what effect of materials its going to use.
364	1	3	3	In order to replicate this procedures, you would need to know
365	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. Also, step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific. They might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate.
366	1	2	2	Addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers. Another thing that would be needed is the types of racks, because the grap didn't specify the different samples in the procedure, the group would also need to tell you what you are using to determine the mass of the samples before and after, for example, they could have said to measure it in grams.
367	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment after reading, you will need to know what the 4 different samples are. You will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the 24 hours.
368	1	0	0	Additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down.
369	1	2	2	I would need how much vinegar im putting in the containers, what kind of  lime and plastic, like where it came from and what kind of temperature should the samples dry in.
370	1	2	2	Some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples ? How much vineger do you have to pour into each container. And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data. We need those information to know how to do this experiment.
371	1	0	0	My opinion is to not change anything because it seems alright it has the 4 samples and the procedure presents the table.
372	1	0	0	You need to repeat the the experiment 2 more time, record all data then compare them to see of samples have any change. Also backround information is important to any experiment.
373	1	1	1	In order to repeat this lab exactly as they did, I would need to know what materials I'd need, for example, the marble, wood, limestone, plastic was not writen in the procedure.
374	1	0	0	In order for you to replicate the experiment, you would have to change the time usage to see if there would be a different outcome. Also in step 2 where it says to pour vinegar in each of the four containers, change how they are using vinegar and substitute it for another liquid to see if these would effect anything. Lastly, I would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer.
375	1	1	1	In this procedure the group calls the materials samples, instead of calling them samples they should have named the materials like they did in the chart. When they just say samples,that can mean anything. In step number one they should say why you need  to determine the mass of the four materials.
376	1	0	0	After you determine the mass of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. Then go and daght a lab report about QV. Then when your done, hand it Qn.
377	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment for acid rain, you need  additional information. First you need to know what type of samples your using. Second, the procedure did not specify  how big each samples should be. Having different sizes might change the results. Lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water, you  should know what temperature to use very hot or very cold water might also change the results.
378	1	2	2	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples.Also they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample + finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in + whether this was the same for each sample. These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment.
379	1	1	1	I think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be, anther is they didn't put in the procedure the names of materials we are using and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measure the difference in masses.
380	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar. In order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it. You also have to do some math to get the difference in mass.
381	1	2	2	To repeat in experiment doing the group procedure I would need to know how much of the vinegar to pour into each container. Another information
382	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup. I would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better explained.
384	1	2	2	I would need to know, how much vinegar was used, how big the containers are and if each sample should be the same mass.
385	1	0	0	More you could repete the expierement just see it.
386	1	1	1	First the experiment needs to have  a controll. They need to put the materials in water to see if it has any affect on the materials. Second they need more than one trial for each material. I suggest three so you recieve better data. The third thing they can do is tell us exactly how much vinegar they are putting into each sample.
387	1	0	0	The limestone have mass than all of them.
388	1	0	0	You would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar, distilled water and some other materials.
390	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. We would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying. And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar.
391	1	2	2	We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup. Also we would need to know how much or each sample to use, and which materials. We would also need a control. So would need to place something in regular water as well.
392	1	1	1	This experement didn't have a controle and the grupe didn't do multiple triles. You would also may need to know what tempriture the rome is.
394	1	1	1	Some additional information thats needed in this experiment, acid rain would be explang more in detail about how to use the steps, ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differc! ways. This experiment snoch be more cleares and you should include a graish. This experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel.
395	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used. Also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicated.Lastly, the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included.
396	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you will need the following vingar, to your in each identical container, you will need to let the sample sit and dry for30 minutes. After 24 hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
397	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers, to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers.
399	1	2	2	Some additional information would include: The amount of vinegar poured into each container, mass of the sample taken and the temperature where the 4 containers were stored for the 24 hours.
400	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it. Also you do not know what the four samples are. In the second step how much vinegar should be poured. In the thats step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable. A last step should  also be included to say repeat.
402	1	2	2	additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment include the amount of vinegar poured  into each container, where the containers are stored or kept for 24 hours, how the samples should be dried, and lastly, with what should the masses be taken on.
403	1	0	0	For one thing to replicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure. They also should state to use, the same mass objects so that it is easy to replicate. Finally, the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment.
404	1	0	0	You would need to state that wood didn't lose any mass, the plastic lost 1 of mass, the marble lost 4 of mass and the limestone lost 1.3 mass. Then you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass.
405	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included. One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container. If there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily. Another thing they would have included is a control without a control, there is nothing to compare your results to. One last thing that is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you must know how much of each sample that you used. If you use more of one sample than another, then of course it is going to way more. Each sample should be the same size.
407	1	0	0	A hypothesis was needed in this experiment. Also, the group should had told the reader what was happening, why the experiment was taking place. Also they should had repeated the steps at least three times to make sure the results where accurate.
408	1	0	0	Additional things a I would need to replicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry.
409	1	2	2	You would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted, what results where they looking for. You should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions. Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
410	1	0	0	You would need 1). More trials 2). Different types of samples and 3). Maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mins.
411	1	0	0	The additional info I would need to replicate it is, marble, limestone, wood, plastic, water, container, vinegar, label.
412	1	2	2	The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure. They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container. The group also does not tell you how to way each sample's mass.
413	1	0	0	Limestone you would need because it's the most important of then it won't work when you used it.
414	1	0	0	They need to repeat every step that already preformed.
415	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's procedure, I would need the following information: ^p 1. When they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples, they should name and list the samples that they plan on using. ^p 2. In step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers, they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in. ^p 3. When they say in step  four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water, how much water should we use and how long should we rinse.
416	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sample. You would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer.
417	1	3	3	In order to replicate, the group students experiment the additional information i would need to  encure, how big the four identical containers were, how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the containers in a warm or cold environment. How much vinegar and the students pour into each container.
418	1	1	1	The iddtional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are the following:what changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs. And the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar,we pour in each four separete but equal containers how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation. What did we learn
419	1	1	1	In order to replicate the group's experiment, there is additional information that would need to be known, such as how much vinegar was poured into the four seperate containers, how much of each sample is used and what the group used in order to determine the mass of each sample.
420	1	2	2	In order to do this experiment again, you would need to know the exact mass of the 4 samples, what kind of samples they are and how long you have to rinse the samples for.
421	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each seperate containers. If I did not have the data table, I would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are. It would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used. In order to replicate on experiement, the procedure must be precise and not have any information out, or else the data may come out completely different and not be comperable to the first set of data.
422	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the quanity of the variables (sample materials). It is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use. Were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water, mostly evapoltantiy I need to know how they determined the mass of the samples, what was their tool of measurement.
423	1	3	3	In order to repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container, how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined & due to the sorroundings it was in.
424	1	3	3	You would need a control to look back on, you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container ip with and get the time right. With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials.
425	1	0	0	What was the purpose for them doing this experiment? ^p Why did they choose to set up there lable this way? ^p And for me to replicate the procedure would be impossible due to the fact that there's no problem also there not alot of information provide that examples the directions.
426	1	0	0	It doesn't tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation. So we would be able to do the work, but I would know what we did if for after.
427	1	1	1	If there is a control they would need to identify it, they should also tell the type of material, tell the mass' unit of measurement.
428	1	3	3	Additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers. Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . Also, although indicated in the data table, the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in. Should it be poured limestone, a block of wood etc. And also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end. All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment.
429	1	0	0	You should in all procedures out in an actually experiments.
430	1	1	1	One step that missed was to gather all all the materials. Another  step  that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup. Another step they might have to add as well is  how much distilled water that would be to one each errape.
431	1	0	0	In addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples.
432	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure, I think they should have added record the data, get materials, observe the expariment and repeat expariment.
433	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information I could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa.
434	1	1	1	I would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes. Also I would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that I have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples.
435	1	0	0	They should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor.
436	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need is to add another independent veriable to the procudure other than venegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar. Also  to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time. Then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples.
437	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, some good additional information would be what the containers are made of, the dependent variable, and the dependent variable.
439	1	2	2	In this experiment an additional iformation to perform the experiment would be that the amount of vinegar is poured into the container. This may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples. I also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass.
440	1	2	2	This group is lacking a control group in their procedure. Also, they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers. Next, the group should have carilified what 4 kind of samples were needed in step 1.
441	1	2	2	First, I would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what the environment is the sample stored would: be stored in over the 24 hour period. ^p Lastly, I would need to measure the mass of the four different samples and the volume of the liquids.
443	1	2	2	There are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it. First, step 1 says, determine the nose of four different samples.They should have said what the samples were of. Second, step 2 says, pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar. Third, there is no control in this experiment. They should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control.
445	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how big samples to use. You would also need to know the problem or what you were testing for in the experiment.
446	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , the group's procedure would need to specify what unit of measurement to measure mass in (g), to specify which samples were being used( marble,limestone,wood, of plastic). and specify the size and type of the containers used (beakers)
447	1	1	1	Additional information need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers, should I buy the materials or use natural resources.
448	1	1	1	If I has to replicate the expinment, I would need to know what types of samples are being used and also if you check it in between the start and stop sign. Also, how do you determine the mass.
449	1	3	3	This information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment; ^p -Amount of vinegar poured ^p -Identify types of samples used in the procedure ^p -Temperature and ^p -Size of containers_open/closed lid
450	1	1	1	After reading this procedure, I would advise these students to make step 3 easier to understand. In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to label what material is going into the container, what you're labeling it, and what single sample enters the container in the end. Also, to make this experiment more reliable, you would need to add more trials to your procedure. Also, if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table, you would need to identify the four samples in step one.
451	1	0	0	One thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger. Also they should have a hypothisis.
452	1	1	1	You would need to add materials that you need to use. You also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups. You should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like A, B, C, D.
453	1	0	0	In order to find the starting mass and ending mass of the containers, you would need to use some sect of measuring material, like a scale, to know the affects of vinegar on the material, you also need all starting mass of materials to be the same mass.
454	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment. Also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers. Finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is tuching it.
455	1	1	1	In the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example, the could say, "Determine the mass of 4 different rock samples". I also think they say sample too many times. You get confused about what they are saying. One last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container.
456	1	0	0	Where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment . Why do you need vinegar? Where does the acid come from?
457	1	0	0	After reading this group's procedure I think they should have used more than four samples so they coold find out different sources from other types of stone. Also I think they should have one more trials.
458	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so I don't put in too much or too little. I would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, if I had only looked at the group's procedure, I would need to know what four samples the students used so that I could replicate the experiment. And then, I would need to know where the containers were kept so I could give mine the same amount of light and other things.
459	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, i determined that in order to replicate the exeperiment additional information is needed. First, the procudere doesn't state what is being tested, we need to know what specific samples are being refered to next we haven't been told how much of each sample is required in the individual containers. Lastly, we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container.
460	1	0	0	The additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples, which is the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The information that is needed is the starting and ending mass.
461	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples, if not then a person might use any different mass samples. Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample. Lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers, to make this procedure replicateable, the group would have to make these change.
463	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would also need to know, in step two how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment.
464	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, in and for me to replicate this experiment, I would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container, the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for. Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment.
465	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers incase the water has an effect on it. Also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results. Last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them.
466	1	3	3	You would need to know what the four different samples are. Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Lastly, you need to know what temperature to store them at.
467	1	3	3	The group's procedure was pretty vague, there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar, and how large the samples are. Also, each sample should be named in the procedure like "Determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood and plastic samples" should be stated in the procedure.
468	1	1	1	To repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers, you  would used to know the purpose of the experiment and what the difference is mass says about the samples.
469	1	3	3	Just based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are.
470	1	0	0	Well you would need samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Three pieces of information, limestone, plastic, marble.
471	1	1	1	After reading this groups procedure some additional information they would need to add to complete this experiment is first, they need to tell you correct measurements such as how much vinegar to pour. Also, they should tell you how to determine the mass of each sample because there are many possible was you could find the temperature or measure it etc. Both of these observations should be added to the produre in order to do the experiment.
472	1	2	2	Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment. First of all, the students need to state exactly what four types of samples to use in the experiment (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). They also need to state in the procedure the amount of vinegar (and type of vinegar) that needs to be put in each cup. The procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the repeated trials.
473	1	3	3	You would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material, for example plastic could
474	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample. Another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical containers. A third piece of information needed in order to replicate this experiment is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak? All of these things are needed in order to be able to replicate this experiment.
475	1	1	1	Information I would need: ^p - what do they want to find out in other words, their implied aim. ^p - the amnt of vinegar. ^p - the amnt of sample.
476	1	2	2	To be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things. For example, do they want us to use the same materials? Of course they do, so that's one. Another is, what kind of containers do they want us using? We can use plastic or metal or another. Lastly, you would need to know how much distilled water that you need.
477	1	1	1	In order to deplicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar the people used. If we don,t know and we use more or less, it could change the experiments outcome. Also , we would need to know all of the tools they used so that we could use the same ones. And finally, it would help if they measured the mass inbetween the 24 hours.
478	1	1	1	One additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar, in ml, is needed to pour into the containers. Every container needs the same amount of vinegar. The other additional information needed is the fact that the difference in mass has to be determined or else, you would miss the point. The third additional information needed is what to measure the samples with and what unit they need to be measured in. They all need the same unit and balance.
479	1	2	2	To repeat this expirement I would need to know what the four samples were and how wide the containers should  be.
480	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the containers the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated.
481	1	1	1	What they missed was the samples that they were pouring, the vinegar on. They need to have every piece of information in the procedure. So other people can do this job.
482	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass, because if we put a different amount we're going to get a different result.
483	1	2	2	One thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container. Also which tsamples are they using and also how much of the sample should u use.For example, the whole object, half the object. Also if they were making a table what information do u need to record.
484	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers. ^p After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p Placing a single sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a singl.
485	1	0	0	You would need: Starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass in order to replicate the experiment.
487	1	0	0	NSR
488	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to pouring, i  sample into more than just one container, instead of rinsing each sample with distilled water, wait 48 hours instead of allowing the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, let it dry for hour.
490	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put into the cups, that way you would get more accurate results.
491	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to use, what size the containers should be and how many trials to conduct to replicate the experiment.
492	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment the following information is needed, the amount of vinger that is needed in this experiment should be given. In this experiment to much or to little virner may be used. There should as be multible trails because the different samples may or may not take any vinger in. And the labeling  may not be the right label. The experiment should tell what each container should be labeled with.
493	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment they would need to determin what the materials were, they would have to establish a control and they would have to give directions to find the difference in mass.
494	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, some information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup. Lastly, you would need to do multiple trials for reliability.
496	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the four different samples are. At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified. The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally, the procedure does not include a control. This doesn't give the readers anything to compare the results.
497	1	0	0	The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble, limestone, wood, and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each. what material did you use to get this answer. What effects did it have on all material such as color and size.
498	1	1	1	1) I would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample. ^p 2) What are they trying to find out through pass is to amount. ^p 3) Was there a control group in this experiment.
499	1	3	3	You would need to know how big of cups to use. How much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get.
500	1	3	3	Some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used, i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh, so they are all equall. What type of container should the sample be put into? how should i determine the mass of the different samples? How much vinegar to pour into the samples?.
501	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar you use, for amount of marble,limestone and wood ,water you could use and has to determine the mass of the material.
502	1	1	1	To exactls replicat this expirement you leashneed to know how much of each sample to test with. Also you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the different cups, lastly you would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with.
503	1	2	2	You need something like a scale to determine the mass. "Determine the mass of four different samples". You need to identify what that sample. You also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed.
505	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinigar they added, what kind of containers, and how much or how big each object is.
506	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the student would need to include how much distilled water the sample should be rinsed with. As well as how they determined the mass of the samples. Lastly, they need to show us how much vinegar they poured into the containers.
507	1	2	2	There are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to replicate the experiment. Some pieces of information they could add are the type of sample to use and the mass each sample should be. These would help because will not them you don't know which samples you are supposed to use and if they're not all the same across you could get invalid results. Also, they need to tell you how much vinegar to put in each cup or else, once again there is a risk of the data being invalid.
508	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need is how much vinegar to put in the four containers, the actually samples they use ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic), and how you would measure the mass of each sample.
510	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment.
511	1	2	2	I would need to know several things before replicating this job. First, I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Also, I would need to know what I should do to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly, I would need to know how much distilled water to use and what identical containers I should use.
512	1	0	0	I would have to write down what causes acid rain and put chemicals make up acid rain and why isn't it poisoning to humans.
514	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in. Secondly, I need to know on what I should place the samples on, to allow them to dry. Lastly, to replicate the experiment I need to know the control group and the type of container I should use. Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on.
515	1	3	3	In order to repeat this experiment you would need to know what containers the samples were put in , how much vinegar to pour into the containers and where you should let the samples dry off.
516	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would also need to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated. You would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical. A third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them. In the procedure the samples' identities are not given.
517	1	1	1	Additional information they could have added is mass, the weight of vinegar poured into the samples. They also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories. 1 more thing that could be changed is have more trials with diffent samples and repeat the process used. Also, they could have waited for more than 30 mins to let the distilled water dry oil out.
518	1	1	1	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do I pour into each container? Also I would need to know the control of the experiment so I could see what changed and how. I also need to know what I should use to measure the mass. They only say nreeus the mass in their experiment, they never told me specifically what to measure it with.
519	1	3	3	More information would be needed to replicate the experiment. It needs to be explained what the samples are of. It should say how much vinegar to use. Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass.
521	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to be more specific. It would need to tell how much vinigar is used in the containers, have a longer drying time because the samples will not be fully dry after 30 minutes and say what the samples are weighed with. It is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles.
522	1	1	1	I would need to know what the samples were.
523	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much of the samples to use, how much vinegar to use and how big the containers have to be.
524	1	0	0	Why they even did it is in the first place. And what am I wanting to replicate the experiment and also where would I get the supplies I needed. And if there's anything that i Shouldn't use in this experiment.
525	1	0	0	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is a watch, a measureing container, also some marbles, limestone, wood and plastic.
527	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each
528	1	2	2	One extra piece of information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the wot that was used to measure mass. I would also need to know what the four different samples were. In addition, I would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used.
530	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the group's hypothesis and whether it was retreat or incorrect. This will help one to eliminate their thinking if they were wrong or to confirm their hypothesis. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, and whether all the containers contained an equal amount of vinegar. Lastly, I would need to see results from a controlled experiment, such as a rock with water and make sure it does not decay.
531	1	2	2	There are several pieces of information that I would need to replicate this experiment. Firstly, in step one, I would want to know specifically what the four different samples were. Secondly, in step two, I need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Thirdly, in step three, I would need to know how much of each material to put into each container. Having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent. All three of these pieces of additional information would extremely helpful in replicating this experiment and avoiding possible source of error while replicating.
532	1	2	2	The three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows:
533	1	0	0	I would have to check the mass of four different samples. Put vinegar in each one of the separate containers. Put a sample of a marble in one container and label it then repeat with the limestone, wood and plastic. While waiting 24 hours. I would remove the samples from their container and rinse them with distilled water then allow the samples to dry for an half an hour.
534	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know what the materials are that you're putting into containers. You also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are. All these things are essential to replicating this experiment.
535	1	2	2	Information I would need to replicate I mass 4 samples. Should I
536	1	1	1	Same additional into that would be needed is how much vinegar should be poured into each container. I would also like to know how much distilled water was used and finally there should be something show who this is determining in the whole procedure to doesn't talk about acid rain once.
537	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know: ^p  1. How much vinegar to put in each container ^p  2. How much water to use when you rinse each sample use distilled water/ temperature of water as well ^p  3. What temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying. ^p  4. How big the containers are ^p  5. What environment is the experiment taking place in? Hot, warm, freezing, wet etc.
538	1	0	0	After reading the group's  procedure, the group should add a hypothesis, controll, and objective.
539	1	2	2	After reading the procedure to their experiment I would also need to know how much vinegar to use, what are we using to determine the mass of each samples from the containers with, and what are the fair samples suppose to be
540	1	2	2	The procedure should contain  what different samples are going to weighed.  It also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers. Lastly the procedure should contain the information if the masses are going to be record do make a data table.
542	1	3	3	Any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples that's mass are being determined, where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water.
543	1	1	1	A couple more things I would write in this experiment would be to make a hypothesis. Also when you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the rocks are in the same place so they all dry evenly. Lastly, I would also I would compare the weights of all the rocks and see which ones heaviest at the begining and the end.
545	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of four peparate but identical, containers. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
546	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rock's masses, how much vinegar you're putting the rocks in . Finally you need to know how much of each sample you're putting in a container.
547	1	2	2	First, you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup. Second you will need to know the temperature of the room. Third, you will also need to know wether the scale used was electric or normal.
548	1	2	2	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include; what the sample materials I was using were, what kind of result am I looking for when receive my data and what is the problem that I am suppose to attempt to solve. It would also be helpful to know where these materials were placed, whether it be in the sun or in the dark. By knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible.
549	1	0	0	One thing they could have that they don't is a control of this procedure.The next thing they could have changed that they could have said how to get or determine the mas of each of the building material.The final thing is that I think with starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals.
550	1	1	1	I would like to know what the experiment is for ? What are the measurements for all this, how much vinegar in each container ?
551	1	2	2	To make this experiment's procedure complete,three additional things are needed. First, the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification. Second, the vinegar being poured into the containers should be measured into a specific amount and the same amount used for all containers. Finally, all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier. These additional steps would make the procedure better.
552	1	3	3	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container. Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials? Also other info would be, what size containers do you need for this experiment. Lastly does it matter the material of the container: glass, metal. Throw away containers.
553	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what the students goal was. I always label how much of an amount to put into a container. In their procedure its that the students did not do this.
556	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in each container. You will also need to know how you are determining the mass of the sample, and what the samples actually are of (what material).
558	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh. You would also need to know what four samples to use. Also, to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container.
559	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need some additional information.I would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of containers to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container.
560	1	1	1	The additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn't say which samples to use in the procedure. You would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass. You would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didn't have a large difference in mass.
561	1	1	1	In step one they could tell you the 4 different samples so that you could know what they are in step three they should tell you the amount os material that you should place in each container. After step number six it should say record data and repeat if needed.
562	1	1	1	There is something missing. In the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers. What it fails to mention is how much vingar to pour into each container. Without this the experiment is impossible to replicate because the independent variable would be the amount of vinager added, but there is no mention of how much to add
563	1	2	2	I would need to know what to measure the weight in, how much vinegear to put in, and how long to rinse each sample with distilled water for.
564	1	1	1	While I would need to know how much to put in each container and were to put these items from, and the fact were this could be done at in or out doors. How to get the starters mass of each sample. Between the starters and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it.
565	1	3	3	If you wish to replicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed, does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel, and tell the size of each of the samples.
566	1	2	2	We would need to know 1) the four types of sample mentioned in  2)  would need to be classified.temperature of vinegar, 3) type of wood /plastic/etc they used,and 4) the amount of vinegar they poured into each container.
567	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use. One would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container. Also, the students should specify what kind of container they are using in order to most closely replicate this.
568	1	2	2	Step one really should go at the end. You need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers. Tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested. Tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it. I would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph.
570	1	1	1	You would need the independent varible that never changes. To replicate the experiment  would need to no exactly how much of the vinegar was poured into each of the four containers. Also how did the mass reacted to the substance.
571	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar. And lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for? Days, weeks,it never tells you this information, it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things.
572	1	0	0	First off, you would need more samples of the rocks to put in the rain. Also, to replicate the experiment you would need to new to state the next day try the experiment all over again. The person replicating it would also have to wait a whole other 24 hours. More water and vinegar would be needed too.
573	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, the Students need to include more detail in their procedure. First, we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment. The students tell us to pour vinegar into containers, however it is not clear how much vinegar to use, if the amounts of vinegar are different, the entire experiment will not be accurate. To improve the experiment, the students could have done more trials to get better observations.
574	1	0	0	I would need to know how
575	1	1	1	One thing they should include is how much vinegars they need in each cup so you can measure be the same in all the containers.
576	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar did the group of students pour in the identical containers, I need to know how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one cup and pour more in the other.
578	1	3	3	You would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain. You would also need to know what type of materials you need. Another piece of needed information is how much vinegar to pour into each container because the more vinegar added,the stronger it may become and therefore the vinegar would be able to eat away at the samples more. You would also need to know where the containers were placed for the 24 hours (whether they were placed at cool temperature, hot or cold.)
579	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each container.You need to know the 4 different samples, what to do with the difference in masses, what do the difference in the mass's tell you?
580	1	0	0	This procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in grams.They gave foour different samples but they didn't include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samples.The purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass i grams and it was compared to the different samples.
581	1	1	1	First off they dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the containers, & also that they should have addedacontrol or just water to have samples to confound and do.
582	1	1	1	the first thing the procedure needs to specific measurements the second thing it needs to identify each material. And the third thing is they need a controlled.
583	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you might need to know how much vinegar to put in the cups.
584	1	1	1	You would  need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples. Also plase the same amount of vinegar  and water into each container, Allowing students to record the correct data.
585	1	2	2	The additional information I need is to know how vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of container am I supposed to know and also how to determine the mass of each object.
586	1	0	0	If I replicated this I would also need what I uses acid rain in measuring the  container masses and how the acid rain would effect
588	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how big of a container to use (what it should be able to hold), how much vinegar to pour into each container ( how many ml ), what type of vinegar, what to weigh the samples on (bathroom scale or type of beam balance, maybe electronic?).
589	1	2	2	The procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first, it should include measurements. We need to know how muche vinegar to put with each sample, second, the procedure does not list what materials to put in the vinegar lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals.
591	1	2	2	In order to replicate this procedure, they should includ a set mass for each stone i.e 10g of each sample. They also shuld include the amount of vinegar to be poured in each cup and the third they should include the size of the container.
592	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of each material was used because it doesn't say in the procedure. I would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. I would also have to know how much water or how long to rinse the samples with the distilled water.
593	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need (other than the procedure) what samples to use (what materials), how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in. These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results. Using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain. Finally, the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during 24 hours.
594	1	2	2	The group needs to include each specific in their conclusion. The amount of vinigar must also be specified as well as the amount of each sample being placed in each container. The group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample. The table provided suggests that the group measured the mass of each sample and the difference between the starting mass and the ending mass but it was never mentioned in their procedure.
595	1	1	1	You may want to tell in the experiment how much vinegar you are pouring in; Explain how you found the differences in mass, mass before you rinse with the distilled water.
596	1	2	2	In the procedure, the group should have included what samples they were going to use (marble, limestone, wood, plastic), the group should have also gave to exact amount of how much vinegar to use in each cup. It would also have been useful if the group would have in the first procedure to measure the mass of each sample separately.
597	1	2	2	The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items. They would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container. It is also important that they include how much or how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water.
598	1	0	0	You wouldn't need any information. They provide you with all the information you need. They tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart.
599	1	2	2	Additional information you would also need is how much vinegar you put the samples in.This doesn't tell you if each sample was covered by vinrgar completely or if it was partially covered.The starting mass of limestone was 9.8g the ending mass was 9.4g that was a - 0.4g difference. The experiment doesn't tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinegar.This is very important to know in order to replicate this experiment.
600	1	1	1	What are the four samples? are what kind of materials you would need, are tgoing out a hypothesis.
601	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what four different samples to use to determine the mass, how much vinegar do I pour in each of the four samples and am I doing all four at the same time. So they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same time.
602	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this groups experiment, I need to know what type of sample am I weighing. I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the containers. I also need to know what I am labeling on containers,and what das I use to remove samples from the containers.
603	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container, the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these 3 things would  make very  experiment as close as possible to the group's.
604	1	2	2	You would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment. One would be how much vinegar to pour into the container. Another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ. A third piece of information needed would be what samples to use. Also, if they should all start out with the same mass or not.
605	1	2	2	The additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container. I also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container. Where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours ? Inside, outside, by a window ?
606	1	2	2	One piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container. Another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples. Also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing.
607	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal. I would also need to know the location of where the containers should be put during the 24 hours (ex: shade/sun). Lastly, I would need to know what kind of container should be used; a plastic, a covered or a dark container etc.
608	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know what the sample was, a desirable range in which the mass could fall under and the amount of solution (vinegar) that should be applied for each sample (Having a large range and an equal amount of solution compromises the validity)
610	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment you are need to divide the different substances add more vinegar to each containers add more distilled water having them sit for 24 hours for about 30 minutes mass them and see how they wash.
611	1	2	2	You need to know how much vinegar to pour in you place the containers will change alittle.
612	1	2	2	1. Have a determined size for the starting samples of rock. ^p 2. Determine an amount of vinegar. ^p 3. Determine what type of containers are being used.
613	1	0	0	You will need to know which rock had the most mass, which one had the least and which one was the same.
614	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure needs to include how much vinegar is going to be poured in the containers, how much water you rinse the containers with, where it is being dried and how to measure the mass (grams, dounds,etc.)
615	1	2	2	I would include the materials used or the "samples". Also they should include in the procedure the type of measuring they are doing, masing, and state how much vinegar to pour in each cup.
616	1	3	3	Additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in, how big the container should be, and if the material should be or shouldn't be fully submerged by the vinegar.
617	1	2	2	One piece of information is that you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into eaach container and you need to know what kind of vinegar you need for the experiment. You also need to know what you're supposed to do with the data after you have collected it to find the answer to your problem. It doesn't say in the procedure to analize the data or anything like that.
618	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each sample. I would also need to know what the control of the experiment was so I could compare results of the samples. Lastly I would need to know if the experiment was completed.
619	1	1	1	*Include the name of the samples in the procedure. ^p *Say how do students measure the mass. ^p *Ask students to obsecvate the data and drawn conclusion.
620	1	1	1	The procedure never states what the samples are.It  needs to add the four samples marbles,limestone,wood and plastic into the first step.The procedure needs to state in the first step that the starting mass i) being measured and in the 6th step that the ending mass is being measured.The procedure also needs to add a step to tell the experimenter to determine the difference in mass from the starting and ending masses
621	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the students are looking for? Why each steps of the procedure is being done? Why those  four samples were chosen and if there should be more trials or repettions , in order to create more accurate data.
622	1	0	0	The additional information you will need to replicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need, how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be.
623	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, there was additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment. First, they didn't state how much vinegar to pour into the containers which is a huge factor. Second, in order to make sure their experiment was valid, they could have done another trial and lastly, they should state the temperature this is all happening at because that could have an effect on the results.
624	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you need to know how much vinegar you need to pour on the four different samples. The second thing you need to know is, what temperature the room is when you start the experiment.The last step is, write a group and write the conclusion of your experiment record.
625	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need some additional information in their procedure. An example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance. They need specifics like how much vinegar they need in each container, or how big the sample is or what the sample is. It's very vague, so they should add more specific.
626	1	0	0	I would need to know what the purpose of me doing the experiment would be and what exactly was I trying to find in order to replicate the experiment.
627	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment some more information that could be used would be to say in the procedure what amount of vinegar to use for all 4 cups.This would make a huge impact on the experiment outcome .Also include the size of the containers to use and the unit to measure the mass of the samples. Say what sample to use in the experiment too.
628	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was to be added to to the four separate containers. Even though the samples are listed in the chart, the group drew the name of the samples should be in the procedure.
629	1	2	2	The  group failed to identify how much vinegar you should pour into each container, what to label the containers, or what "materials" to put in the containers.They also forgot to include safety procedures and did not tell you to measure the different in or masses to carry the smals.
630	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I think that in order to replicate these experiment I will need to know what type of container and about how much vinigar to put into the conlainer.
631	1	2	2	The additional information that this experiment needs are the amount of vinegar to pour in each containar and say exactly what four samples you are using. You need to have these thingsin an experiment because if you don't, then you wouldn t know what you are experimenting and what is making that change. you also need a control group.
632	1	3	3	To tell me what the samples are in the procedure. ^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers. ^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in.
633	1	2	2	The biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalide. Another problem is that they didn't mention how much vinegar should be used. The group wasn't very specific, for example they didn't say what temp. the samples should be kept at. By not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid.
634	1	0	0	After you remove the containers, you rinse them & see what results you get in about so minutes.
635	1	1	1	You would need to know the conditions of the sample: ^p -You would need to know what type of plastic because their are so many different plastics. ^p -You would need to know what type of wood because their are so many different types. ^p -You would also want to know the acidic level of their particular vinegar.
636	1	1	1	To be able to replicate the expariment, you would need to know the 4 samples you are exparimenting with. Although the 4 samples are listed in the data shown below the procedure, it doesn't show the samples in the procedure and if I was to do the expariment without the other groups data, there is no way I could without knowing the samples.
637	1	0	0	I would need vinegar, 4 containers, labels, time (24hours) a sink, 30 minutes for them to dry and a tripple beam ballance scale.
638	1	3	3	A person trying to replicate this experiment would need to know what type of containers to put the samples in, how much vinegar should be added at the temperature that the containers should be kept under. All of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know.
639	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment the information that i would need is how much vinegar do i pour on each sample. Also i would need to know what type of vinegar to use and do i put the samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature.
640	1	2	2	After reading the groups, I would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment. I would also need to know what kind of scale to use to determine the mass of the objects & also what kind of container to use.
641	1	0	0	I would need to know what was happening to the samples during that 24 hrs. 2 I would need to know why they chose the four samples that they did. 3. I would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself.
642	1	1	1	One idea they might need to use, is to say what four materials/sabstones are being used in your procedure. Also they should be sure to use a control in this experiment(missing). The group should also  used more than one trial to their experiment/lab.
643	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container, so the results are accurate. You would need to know how big each sample was you would also need to know what temperature this experiment was done at.
644	1	1	1	In my experiment  I would include steps: ^p 1. Gathering materials. ^p 2. Observation of the substances. ^p 3. Making sure no particles were lost in the rinsing of water.
646	1	2	2	The group will need
647	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure: ^p 1.How big should the rock samples be? ^p should they be relatively the same size? ^p 2. How much vinegar should be poured into the containers? ^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water? ^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material?
648	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour, what temperature to keep the experiment anothe vinegar, and what temperature to keep the experiment drying.
650	1	0	0	To replicate the experiments you will need all the samples and how you will need more acid rain.
651	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what types of samples you should you should be using, how much vinegar you should put in each container, and you would also need to know how to separate the samples from the vinegar or whether or not the vinegar would be included when finally weighing the end mass of the samples.
652	1	2	2	The person doing the experiment would need to know how much vingear was poured into the container; what type of container they used. (plastic, metal, glass, etc; whether or not the person would need gloves, tongs and other utensils. You will also need a three beam scale to measure your materials before and after.
653	1	1	1	In order to replicate this expirement, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. Different amounts of vinegar would add another variable to the expirement , compromising the results.
654	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar you poured, the pH level of th vinegar , and much of the sample was added into the vinegar.
656	1	3	3	I would need to know what the samples were of, how much vinegar, what containers, what material & how much of that material.
657	1	2	2	I would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container. I also would need to know how many trials were their. In addition I would need to know what type of vinegar was used.
658	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples. I would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poored into each of the containers. And what tempeture are the samples kept at for constain amount of time and how long for each time period.
659	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, you would need to how to determine mass. Not to mention, you would need to know in what temperature would need to leave the samples to dry.
660	1	0	0	After reading the group's procedure they would need these four samples they need need to put down what there procedure is about.
661	1	1	1	They could have told us the amount of vinigar used, what they used to make the distilled water, and the could have explained how to rinse the material. I we should sook it in the water for a fewseconds or just rinse them.
662	1	2	2	The group of students investigating acid rain are missing several pieces of vitel information som ther data quatative data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass unserturetly only  one type of quatetive data is recorded the sample type eg in a get the container and vngr types are not this causes type as different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the ^p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate an experiment the material and procedure have to be as close to the original as possible.
663	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the readly of vinegar used with each materials. I would also need to know what kind of plastic they used in the expensal, because there are many diffrent
664	1	2	2	These other pieces of information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment as are what do I obtain marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Since there as the of materials
666	1	1	1	Additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar to put in the different samples, what the constant variable is and how to determine the mass of each sample.
667	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of containers to use, how much vinegar and
668	1	0	0	One would need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them. Try to find out witch one can be is acid rain and not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence.
669	1	0	0	My first piece of information would be a bar graph then I would give specific directions on what I did. But I would make it clear so other people can easily do it to. Then I would write a conclusion why this prblly happened.
670	1	0	0	I would write what
671	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, there is quite a few other pieces of info that they need. First, you need to know how vinegar you have to pour on each sample. Secondly you need to know how much of each sample you need. Finally, you need to know the mass of the cups so you don't mix up the sample weight. That's the information you need to replicate this expiriment.
672	1	2	2	It should say how much vinegar they use in each container, it should say in the procedure what the 4 samples are that they are using. Each sample of the material they were using should have the same starting mass and same amount of vinegar should be used in each.
674	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample. Different amounts of vinegar would give different results. You'd also need to know what to determine the mass with and what materials were used.
675	1	1	1	I would need to know what kind of instrument they used in order to determine the mass, I would need to know what sample materials I'm using in the procedure and I would need to know how many trials I would need to do.
676	1	0	0	You will need a solution, results and a conclusion.
677	1	3	3	From this experiment, I would need to know how big each of the containers are, I would also like to know how much vinegar was placed in each container If I was to replicate this experiment. I would also need to know how long to rinse off the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their containers.
678	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would have to know how much vinegar to poor. I would have to know whatknd of samples to use.
679	1	0	0	The additional information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment is a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container. After 24 hours remove the samples and allow samples to sit and dry. The additional information that would be needed is the starting mass the ending and the difference.
680	1	0	0	You would need to add the type of solution the stones on goingin.
681	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, the group's procedure should include more specific information. They should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples. They should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be labled. This will make the procedure easier to follow. It would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the containers.
682	1	0	0	One additional piece of information that they did not add in the procedure was to determine the change in mass from before and after the experiment. Also, between steps 1 and 2, there needs to be a step to put the samples in the 4 seperate, but identical containers.
683	1	2	2	How much vinegar is needed in each dish. What is the sample material. And how do you determine the mass.
684	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need the size the four containers are, what the students used to measure the mass and how they got the answer of what the mass is. And how much vinegar the students poured into each container.
685	1	2	2	After reading the group experiment I belive that they will need multipule trials, they also need a control. What type of container, how much vinager. Also what you would use to find the mass.
686	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know a control the remocture to keep the containers at, and you need to know how much vinegar.
687	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment information would have to be added to the procedure. I would need to know how much vinegar was put to each of the containers so that I can make sure some of them gets the same amount. Also, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples (by using a balance, or scale, etc). Finally I would need to know if the containers were closed or not, because that environmental factor could change the results of an/my/their experiment.
688	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know the exact measurement of vinegar they used. Second, they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar. Lastly, to repllcate this experiment, you would need to know the amount of time that you rinse each material. So the all came out equal. You would need to know all of these steps because otherwise they could be venables alering the result of the experiment.
689	1	3	3	To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples. Also, there should be more specific size measurements of the containar. Lastly, they never say how much vinegar to use. ^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment.
690	1	0	0	According to the data that the students recorded, the starting mass had higher levels  the ending had some other high and low levels and the difference on mass had some law numbers out an order to replicate the experience I would  never backround hypothesis graft, counclution, problem, materials I think that what i will need in order to replicate the experiment.
692	1	3	3	The procedure is unclear. In order to effectively replicate this experiment. I would need to know what the four samples that are needed, were, i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would help to know how  large each container was as well.^p1.vinegar amount. 2. types of sampling. 3. containers size.
693	1	2	2	The first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers. How much distilled water has to be used to wash them and does the containers need to do the present exciddion
697	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment you would need know how much vineger to put in each containers, what type of scale to use to determine the mass. Also the type of container needed.
699	1	1	1	In step 2 of says to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
700	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need is, I would need to know how much vinegar t put into the containers. I would also need to know what the samples are. To replicate the experiment I would need to know where to put the container weather it be in the same room temperature or anywhere else.
701	1	3	3	To replicate this, I need to know what samples I'm working with. It doesn't tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups. If says after 24 hours remove samples from the containers, where do they go for 24 hours?
702	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples. To the different samples were listed in the procedure, it would be betterunderstand. It would also be useful to state the purpose of the experiment which is to record vinegar's effect on the mass of the samples. It would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container.
703	1	1	1	The additional information I would need is how to determine the mass of four different samples. It is well specified. Also I need to know how much vinegar to pour into different containers, then after the experiment is complete I would need to figure out how to determine the mass of the samples.
705	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to find out exactly what samples were tested in this case. The samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to find out when the experiment was being conducted and whose you're testing.
706	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use. Also, they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion.
707	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know many details. First, I would need to know what samples I am using in order to find their mass. I also would need to know how large each material is. This way I can perform an accurate best because I would know how large the material was. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups so that each material recieves the same amount. Last, I would need to know how to rinse each material so that they all recieve the same amount of water.
708	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure would need to include what each of the 4 different samples were, determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state  the conditions the sample would be in,for example the temp. of the room.
709	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample.
710	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water.
711	1	0	0	The additional information you would needs wch one was the best marble, limestone,wood and plastic.
712	1	3	3	At the start of the procedure, we would need to know what four samples we were testing. Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment. We also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers. We finally would also need to know what kind of containers we would put the samples in, plastic, glass? We need to know this as well.
713	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure. Also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given.
714	1	0	0	This experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment. They should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass.
715	1	2	2	Three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is, 1. To know how much vinegar to use, 2. what is the control, if any and 3. Do you cover the samples over the 24 hr  period,or do you just leave them uncovered?
716	1	1	1	If this experiment was going to be repeated, a control  would need to be used. Instead of using vinegar, the materials would be placed in water. Also, the procedure does not clearly state how much vinegar is used on each material. The amounts should be equal to balance it out. Changing the amount of time the samples sit inside the containers could also change the results of the experiment.
717	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in. They need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis.
719	1	1	1	I would write down how much vinegar they put in these 4 different example of mass. They didn't keep track of the experiment.^p They also didn't repeted the experiment again and I think thats one of the most important thing that everybody should do.
720	1	1	1	I think they should also  put why are they doing it I mean, what is the main idea of it because just to say they are trying to determine the masses of four different samples like the temperature, volume, how  ro the samples in a determined place etc.
721	1	1	1	Addition infarmation you would need in order to replicate the experiment would include controls such as how much of amount of vinegar is needed, in step 2 you would also need a specific or a set amount of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need to make trials in the experiment to make sure the results are valid.
722	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment the scientist needs to know the amount of vinegar to pour in, also wt kind of container, the label's title, and the device used to measure the mass.
723	1	0	0	How much do you pour in the containers.
724	1	0	0	They also should watch how all the samples change and take notes. See if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they. Then see how it changes during the day.
725	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container. You should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar. Lastly, you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out.
726	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you also need to know what types of sample materials will be more, how much of  each sample material needed, and how much vinegar you should pour into each container. By having this information, the lab will be more accurate and correct.
727	1	1	1	The additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar (which may have represented acid rain with a P.H of 3.2:) was put into each sample since: ^p -There were different masses of the given samples eg. marble, 9.8g whereas wood 11.2g. ^p -The ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled. ^p -The mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use, just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
728	1	3	3	After reading this procedure, I have noticed that I would need to know the Ph of the vinegar. Also I would need to kno how much vinegar is needed. Lastly, it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubes off  on the samples making the results diffrent.
729	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, they should say what temperature to keep the room at, they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results. And also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in, because if one sample is bigger than another, that will also change the results.
730	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's experiment i would need to know the samples being used, how much vinegar to use and also what to lable. Without this information it would be very difficult to replicate the experiment with just using their procedure because it is not specific enough and doesn't include all the information needed.
731	1	2	2	The students should state what the four different samples are, state how much vinigar should be used in each samples container. Also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinigar in their eye.
732	1	2	2	Three additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment are, how much vinegar is needed to be poured, how long do you rinse the containers for. What do you measure the mass in
733	1	2	2	In order to replicate this lab experiment you would need to know what the names of the four different samples are. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four containers, so there is an even amount in each container. Another thing you would need to know when replicating this experiment is what you are using to find the mass.
734	1	2	2	I would need to know what kind of samples to use, how much vinegar to put on the samples and how  to label the containers to replicate the experiment.
735	1	0	0	In order needs say the information.
737	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate the experiment they would first have to be more specific and tell what the samples had to be. That is the only thing they would need to do.
738	1	1	1	The students didnot start with saying what materials ar needed. They also didnt say what the four samples were. The students did specify on what kind of materials they were useing!
740	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure I have determined they could add what 'four different samples' you are using during the experiment. The group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers. The temperature at which the ''samples'' are to dry ifor 30 min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined.
741	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need to most importantly state what the experiment is for, name the materials used and a hypothesis for the experiment.
742	1	0	0	For the information you would need all three pieces to describe the additional information, which is starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass. The items are marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment.
743	1	0	0	I will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24. 24 hours, I remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water and after I determine the mass of each sample.
744	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers, the size of the containers themselves, and how long I would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vineger.
746	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment i will need to say that,"List what will be the material going inside the container". ^p I will also have to add in water what will have to be four different samples.3 identify how much amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the of the materials.
747	1	3	3	You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not.
748	1	2	2	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is needed in each container. And also the site of the container needed for this experiment.
749	1	2	2	They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container. They should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container. They need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours. Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes.
750	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know a saw things. i would need to know how much vinegar they used, what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used.
752	1	0	0	Take an hypothesis of what masses they'll have, analyze your results and make a conclusion to the problem.
753	1	2	2	The additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar plced in each cup I would also need to know how much each cup weighs by itself. I would need to know how big each individed
755	1	0	0	Packet in fat it don't make no sense.
756	1	2	2	To replicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the containers. You would also need to how big of containers to use and you need to have more than one teal for each of the sediments to use.
757	1	1	1	Some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but stilking with
759	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment from the procedure what the four samples are must be included.In step 2, the size of the container must be included.For step, the units being used used to be stated.
760	1	1	1	The additional info that you need is a control, how much vinegar you are adding and how much of the material is used.
761	1	1	1	The first thing that they are missing is the amount of vinegar. They didn't go into enough detail on what their experiment is about.
763	1	2	2	Additional information that you would need are the amount of vinegar that you pour into the samples, the temperature which you take the experiment and the efficiency of experiment. ^p + Vinegar affects the mass of sample (when it go inside - absorb). ^p + Temperature affects evaporation. ^p + Efficiency; when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions.
764	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. That would ensure that the differences in mass of the rocks was because of the rocks, and not the amount of vinegar. Also, I may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list.
765	1	0	0	The additional information I would add would  be to record the data at the end of the procedure. Find the average of the samples. To find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container.
766	1	1	1	I will need for them to write the independent variable and the dependent variable before any thing else. They could of put doing how much vinegar they put in all four different samples.
767	1	1	1	Numbe one, you need to know how much vinegar needs to go into the containers.
768	1	1	1	In the procedure, the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four containers. However, the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added. By not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students' amount. Also, there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found.
769	1	2	2	You would need to know how much wood, limestone, marble, and plastic you would need. Also how much vinegar to put in the container. How long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water? Those are the information that you would need to do this experiment.
770	1	2	2	The group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container. In their procedure, they also should have
771	1	2	2	If you were going to replicate the experiment you would also need to know: ^p What the samples are ( so you could use them) ^p How much vinegar to put into the containers. ^p What materials you need to gather without the above information you couidn't properly replicate the experiment.
772	1	0	0	The procedure could be better  if they included  inthere experiment a control, if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood or plastic. Last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose, why are they doing this experiment ? Is it nessecary, what varaety do they receive from this.
773	1	2	2	To replicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighting. The students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested. The final thing would be that the whole procedure needs to be more thorough and more organised with no missing steps or information.
774	1	0	0	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass again,do everything you did already but start with the information you already have,then determine the mass you end up with,and the difference in the mass. That's how I would replicate the experiment.
775	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you would need to include a couple steps to the procedure in order to make it clear and valid. They should add a control to it to improve it with their results and to make it more clear include. Lastly, that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass.
776	1	0	0	Additional information that should've been added to the acid rain experiment is that there needed to be more samples becaus somthing could've went wrong during at least one of the trials. Bin they didnt just try a plain trial with other things to see if it effected the ending mass.
777	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure should mention which samples to use. (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). It should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container, and the size of the samples needed for testing.
778	1	1	1	After you would rinse each sample, it would be best to check the temporter, how much vinegar where used and I would like to know specifcly how many acid you use in this experiment.
779	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, we  would need to know : ^p (1) Which kind of samples to use. ^p (2)  How much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p (3) How much of each sample to use.
780	1	0	0	Limestone has the highest starting mass then come wood, marble, and plastic so this investigation is complete.
781	1	2	2	There are a few additional pieces of information that one would need in order to replicate the experiment. First of all, the procedure fails to mention what the sample materials are, so their names would have to be included in the first step. Additionally, the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container. In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers. Finally, the last step states, to determine the mass of each sample, but does not give a unit of measurement. Therefore, it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams. With this additional information, one could now replicate the experiment.
782	1	2	2	To replicate the group's experiment, more information is neccesary. The students should have included the material types instead of "four different samples" and should have included the measurements used such as amount of each sample, container size.
783	1	0	0	On the groups procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothings happens to the sample in 24 hours and how do you find the difference in mass.
784	1	1	1	They should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using, their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idem was affected.
785	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know which 4 samples to use. Then, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, which is very important. Finally, I would need to know what to label each container. In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly. Adding on, I would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately.
787	1	2	2	Some additional information that you would need to add is the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass because in there procedure they also dont know the sought amount to pour vinegar in the container it just says pour vinegar. They should also say what the sample is.
788	1	3	3	How much vinegar they aded into each container and how long do you rise each sample for, also the temperature the writer would be, Where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold /hot areas.
789	1	2	2	Some additional informetion that would be needed is for number 2, how much vineagar is needed, the size that the containers should be and also another peice of informetion needed is when and what information should be recorded.
790	1	2	2	Information needed to replicate this would be to know how much vinegar is needed in each container, what would we use to determine the mass of the samples and what size containers should be used.
791	1	0	0	1.You will need on hypothesis. ^p 2.You will need a independent variable. ^p 3.You will need a dependant variable.
792	1	0	0	After reading their procedure, I don't even know what they are trying to do. If it was my procedure, I would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on. I would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well.
793	1	2	2	In order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are. How much vinegar should  be pour  into the containers. And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample.
794	1	1	1	After reading this group procedure, some information that I would need is replicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample, what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these containers. Without this information it is experiment would not be considered valid. There would be no control samples the amount of vinegar may not be the same and there is no information is no information on finding the mass.
795	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what materials I needed, what kind of sample and how much of it.
798	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the expirement is to say how many containers and what size, how many containers and what size, how much of the sample to put in the container.
799	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, additional information is needed . First, the amount of vinegar would be needed. Also, the type of wood used would be needed because different woods have different densities. Finally, the temperatures of the room, where the solutions sat, needs to be known.
800	1	0	0	You would need to give information on what the experiment is about.
801	1	0	0	The first thing thing they did wrong was they didn't explain what their objective and investigation was about. Also they didn't compare any data and talk about the difference in the mass.  They got information, but it did not have any mention to it.
802	1	0	0	This is a clear investigation of the Acid rain , they clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending mass and the differece in mass.
803	1	1	1	The procedure should include what type of measurement to measure the 4 samples in, which would he grams as shown in the data table. Also what to measure them with. It should specify the amount of vinegar which needs to be poured into the containers. And finally, the procedure should explain how to determine the masses of the samples  in step 6
804	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, additional information is needed. You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, in step 3, you need to know what material you are putting in each container. You also should know how long to rinse the samples and how much water to rinse them in (step 4).
807	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure, the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples. The group does not say what they are, also one ober not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into each container. The group also needs to put into there procedure what measurement they should and call use to weight the mass of each sample.
808	1	0	0	Additional information that we would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to get 4 cups, weigh the 4 cups and then put labels in the four cups with vinegar.
809	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment additional iformation is needed. The samples ^p need to be listed. Also why those  samples were chosen needs  to be ^p added in order to replicate the experiment. Another thing that needs to be added is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass.
810	1	3	3	In order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. I would also need to know what type of container. I would even like
811	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would have to know how much vinegar to use in each container, you'd need to know what time you started so that you could remove the samples from the containers as soon as exactly 24hrs have passed and lastly you'd need to know what time you set the samples out to dry so they can dry for the full 30min.
812	1	1	1	I would need to know how much vinegar to be able to do this experiment.
813	1	0	0	Need an exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and IV and ov.
814	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the brand of vinegar,
815	1	1	1	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of rock, vinegar and distilled water.These measurements would be a necessity because they are not given but will determine the outcome of the experiment. The amount of rock is what is being tested. The amount of vinegar is independent variable. The amount of distilled water determine how much vinegar is washed away.
816	1	0	0	The information i want is the measures how much did you put in each cup put the table in order from small or large.
817	1	2	2	In this Acid rain procedure, it says to add vinegar into each container, you to put how much vinegar to put in each and you need to lable the containers you need to also clear she what material are being investigated. Give a start and stop time put safety googles on.
818	1	3	3	Some additional information I would include on the group's procedue would be to specify the types of "samples" from the first step. Also, to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be. The way the masses were measuredshould also be included, along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain. The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well. Lastly, they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar.
819	1	3	3	this experiment ^p In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar put on the container, the size of the samples I'd need to know with what they measured the starting and ending mass of the samples, what kind of container do i have to use.
821	1	2	2	Firstly, it is needed to be known how much vinegar should be pouredinto each of the four seperate containers.
822	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's procedure I would need some more information. I would need to know what the samples were. I would need to know the PH vuel of the vinegar, and I would need to know if there was any control in the experiment.

824	1	3	3	In order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information. First, they need to specity what the
825	1	2	2	If I were to replicate this experiment by looking at the procedure I would need a little more information to make it accurate. First of all you would need to know what the different samples were (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). I would also need to know that I had to measure the mass in grams and I would also need to know how much vinegar I need to pour in each cup.
827	1	2	2	You would need to know what kinds of stones were used in order to get similar results. you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample. You should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample.
828	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much vinegar they put in each single container, you will need the size of the single containers and you need to determine the same masses for the materials.
829	1	1	1	The additional information I would need is how many trials they're going to do. Also how much vinegar they have to por in each container. Another piece of information they should have added is the safety things you need,goggles,gloves etc.
830	1	1	1	Some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the containers or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Also since there is multiple varieties of plastic.they could state what kind of plastic they used.
831	1	0	0	You would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed.
832	1	2	2	The procedures needs to tell me how much vinegar I'll be pouring into the containers, also what kind of container I'll be using. When determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use such as a triple beam balanced or no electronic soaks.
833	1	3	3	In order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container. Also what size container should be used. Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at. Lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed.
834	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container.
835	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment with only the procedure, one would need to know what the given materials are . One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup. Without this information, the results would be inaccurate. In addition, one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample. This information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment.
836	1	2	2	I would  need to know the original size of each of the four different samples. It is important to have them all be the same size. I would also  need to how much vinegars to put in the containers. The third, piece of additional information I would need to know is how much much distilled water I should rinse off each sample with.
838	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into the containers. You would also need to know how much marble, limestone, wood and plastic are needed in each container. Last, you would want to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold.
839	1	0	0	Before weighing starting mass weigh each container alone then with the samples.
840	1	0	0	You have to minus the ending mass from the starting mass.
841	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure the additional information, the info i need is how much vinegar should i pour into the four different cups, how could i prove to make sure its right without more than one trail, what are they really trying to investigate, also what are they actual trying to determine.
842	1	1	1	The 3 pieces of information you would kneed to know in order to replicate the experiment is, you need to know how much vinegar you are going to pour in each container, how big in diameter the marble are and what is the mass before you put the marble in the vinegar.
843	1	1	1	In order to replicate experiment I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in each container, how much of each sample to put in the container, and
844	1	3	3	If I was going to repeat this experimen I would need to Know 2 things about the vinegar I would need to know how much vinegar to put the samples in and what type of vinegar.What type of plastic would I need what temperature would I put the samples soak in.
845	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is:How much vinegar was used, how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry (tinet paper towel in the sun.etc)
846	1	1	1	I believe that they should of put more information for example what happen when they were done with the experiment and what would happen if they didn't pour the right amount of vinegar that was needed.
847	1	3	3	Some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to replicate their investigation, would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container, the size or amount of each sample needed & the type of containers to hold each sample in.
848	1	0	0	In this experiment you need to know the starting mass of all 4 samples and the ending mass of all of them. You may also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for 24 hours. What would that do to the samples.
849	1	1	1	To replicate this you would a hypothesis. Also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample. You would not be able to retest this experiment this information. One other thing you might need is a control for the experiment, something to compare the results with.
850	1	2	2	I would need to know the problem and what tools to use and if I have to use marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how much vineger to use I would also need to know is how big the container is.
851	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment I would need the data, the samples of the experiment and I would also need the equipment.
852	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample. Also, I would need to know how to mass the samples ("determine the mass" is too vague sets no 4). Finally, I would need to know what type of containers to use (plastic cups? Styrofoam? covers? ^p Initial amount for each samples.
853	1	0	0	The first starting mass was for wood 11.2g ending mass 11.2g and difference in mass 0.0g. Second was limestone with starting mass 10.4g, ending mass 9.1g difference -1.3g. Third starting mass was marble 9.8g ending mass at 9.4g and difference in mass -0.4g. Last was plastic starting mass 7.2g ending mass 7.1g difference -0.1g.
854	1	0	0	The group would need to table the date, explain what they are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the  outcome of their experiment was. This will help the panature to make and sence as to what you are trying to find out and, day.
855	1	2	2	Some additional information how much vinegar do I pour into the cup. Wha sample materials are they useing. How do I find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be adde.
856	1	0	0	I would need the procedure, the samples, starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
857	1	2	2	Additional information I would need to know would have to be the amount of vinegar the students put into each container. I would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment.
858	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure,some additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be: ^p                               1) To know the amount of vinegar they used ^p                               2) To know what their control variable is and their independent variables are since  they didn't label that ^p                               3) To Know whether or not the mass of the materials was with the mass of the container, because that will effect the results and decrease validity.
860	1	3	3	One piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers. A second piece is to know samples of what the first step says 4 samples but can they be anything? Lastly, i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment. I should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that.
861	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure I think that they should say in their chart how much vinegar they put in the identical containers. Also they should put in the chart the time difference or did they do it at the same time; and what kind of containers did they use ? Beaker, test tube, a regular container ?
862	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know, how much vinegar to use in the samples, two, how big the pieces of rocks are,if they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the containers, do they need a lid to cover evaporation, how large are they. More specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here.
863	1	0	0	3. place marble, limestone, wood and plastic into separate containers. ^p 4. Let them sit for 24 hours and remove them after and rinse them with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes.
864	1	2	2	The additional information I would need would be how much vinegar to pour into each container also how long it rinse after the 24 hours, and a problem statement said also be necessary.
865	1	2	2	In this experiment, the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure. When it tells us to pour the vinegar in each of the containers, it doesn't tel me how much i should fill in them. Step 3 is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container, it doesn't explain the sample. Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples.
866	1	2	2	First you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent. Next, you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster. Also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds.
867	1	1	1	When simulating acid rain in this experiment it would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accurate.They should start with the same ammount of mass ea each sample.  so  the change is seen easier and each sample is affected equally. By the same wage, It is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of vinegar. B/C the labs goal is to nonce change based on acid rain, its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible.
868	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed. The size of the container needs to be determined. also, the procedure just says four different samples, it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Finally it doesn't say how long the sample should be rinced for. If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated.
869	1	1	1	There is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot. You need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup. If you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct. You should have the vinegar at a constant measurement.
870	1	2	2	First, you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container. Second, you need a control for comparison purposes. Third, you need to state the size of the containers.
871	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to why they are preforming this experiment and what it is trying to prove. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to keep that a constant. Lastly, it would be important to know the amount of each sample to add to the vinegar so that the samples aren't different because that could vary your results.
873	1	2	2	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how many m/s of vinegar would I pour into the four containers. Also, I would need to know what material to put in each container. I would also need to know the measurment.
874	1	3	3	In the students procedure, you would need to include the step for measuring out an exact amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the containers and they would need to include the amount of distilled water to rinse with in order to increase the validity. Also, they should specify what type of container to put each sample in, such as a test tube or a beaker. The students should specify what samples to use in step 1 as well, so that when replicated the same samples will be used.
876	1	1	1	How much vinegar you will need to put in the container, what is the control variable, what's the dependent  and independent variable.
877	1	0	0	What you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for 24 hours, and not any other time .How you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for 30 min.
878	1	0	0	In the experiment, they wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone, the one that went down the most. If the experiment was for an hour it would double.
879	1	1	1	1) How much of each sample should i use to replicate the experiment. ^p 2) How much vinegar should i use when replicating the experiment. ^p 3) What should i use to determine the mass in my experiment.
880	1	1	1	To successfully replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials. I would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar. The final piece of information I would need to know is how much distilled water I am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples.
881	1	0	0	To make a hypothesis. ^p After to make a conclution. ^p Determine if the investigation is good or bad.
882	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I need to know the exact volume of the vinegar at the begining, and the volume at the end of the experiment.
883	1	2	2	I would need to know what the four different samples of material I was massing were. I would need to know how much vinegar to add. I would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found. In the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment, (goggles, hat)
884	1	2	2	They need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container. They need to tell like where they will place the containers, if it has to be in warm place or room temperature. They have actually determine the mass.
885	1	2	2	To be able to do the same experiment exactly the way the group of students did I would need the amount of vinegar in each asp. I would also need to know the environment around the samples for example, the temperature they were left to sit in. Lastly, I would try to keep the starting masses about the same for each material and give the number in the procedure.
886	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of sample material is needed, how much vineagar to put in each container, and how much of each sample is necessary to get the best results.
887	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I would need additional information in each to replicate this experiment. For example, I would need to know how big should the containers be to put the sample. Then, how much vinegar should be added to each container. Finally, I would need to know if all the four samples be put in the container at the same or will it affect the final results of the experiment.
888	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need is know what type of sample I would need to measure the mass. Additionally I would need to know what kind of containers to put the samples in. Also I would need to know how to measure the mass of the sample before and after the experiment.
890	1	2	2	What kind of containers?Big small? what are the samples? They don't tell us what they are they could be anything you don't know there rocks until you look at the data table.In this they say to place a sample of a material into a container and label. What sample? what material? What containers and what are we supposed to label? the sample or what is being put into?
891	1	1	1	In order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions.
892	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need the following information. You would need the amount of vinegar, the students used, you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of containers that were used. Also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used.
893	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the pH of the vinegar and the room temperature
894	1	3	3	a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p b The size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment. ^p c Would need to know what materials to gather.
895	1	2	2	I would need to know what are the samples, like the ones they put in their table at other ones. They don't state what the samples have to be .  They also don't say how much should the samples weigh. They also don't say how much vinegar should  be used.  Should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts.
896	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know the most important part of the experiment, the samples I would use. In the procedure the group does not say that you need marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Additional information I would need would be how much of each sample I would need because I may need a band or ocuple of ances and I would need to know how much vinegar to use for each sample.
897	1	0	0	This table is not so clear it only has the dependent variables. It's still missing the control group. The indepent variable is the change in mass. The purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples.
898	1	2	2	The three additional information you would need for a complete procedure for acid rain would be telling what each sample was in order to do the project. And also how much vinegar to put inside each separate container and last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after 24 hours process.
899	1	0	0	Well first thing they do was they determine the mass of the samples, they Vinegar on different samples and than they wash it with water.
900	1	0	0	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is determining the mass of force different samples, make sure you let  it sit for a white and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
902	1	1	1	Additional information that the group would need in their procedure is a hypothesis to get them started. A final statement at the end of the experiment to clarify whether or not their procedure was accurate. One important thing they need to mention in this procedure is, what four different materials we are using.
903	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the group needs to clarify a certain mass for all of the samples. Otherwise, the data can be affected without this constant. Also, it is important to include what samples are from since the data table clarifies that marble, limestone, wood and plastic are the specific materials used. This needs to be included in the procedure. Finally, the group needs to include a specific amount of vinegar paired into each cup so that variations in the amount of vinegar don't affect the validity of the experiment.
904	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, one would need to know, first or all ,what each sample is. They would also need to know  how much vinegar to use on the materials.Lastly they would need to know how many samples of each material.The would need and the substance size.
905	1	2	2	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be, what the sample are, how much vinegar i am supposed to pour into the container and lastly, how do i determine the mass of each sample (In other words what type of measuring device do i use).
906	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment first off I have to know which sample is which. When recording the mass I will not know which belongings to the correct sample. Also it does not tell us in what metric unit we are measuring the samples with, so this needs to be clearer. Last of all, in order to replicate this experiment I need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the containers, because different amounts of vinegar can change the results. Last of all in step 4 it tell us to remove the samples, but I do not know ways to remove those samples, in a seperat cup or container?
907	1	3	3	So additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
908	1	0	0	You would need the starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass.
910	1	1	1	Additional information needed in order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container. if you do too much it's or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried. Also naming the containers with each sample so you know what when you write down your data. Including record data would or additional information too because if it wasn't without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down.
911	1	0	0	What is the independent variable and what the devendent variable also don't ^p forget about the control.
912	1	0	0	In order for or to replicate the experiment, the chart needs to show every pice of the experiment like what hapend when you put Vinegar on four separate pices but identical containers, on how you put one pice of of material in one container and label them the doing the with the remaining samples one pice of material in one container for all of it each. By showing all the data then you'll be able to replicate the experiment.
913	1	2	2	One thing you would need to know is how much vinegar in step 2, to pour into the containers. Another piece of information that would be helpful for this procedure is how much of each sample you need to put into the container in step 3. A last thing you need to know is how long do you rinse the sample off for, in step 4.
914	1	1	1	1. You need to know the amount of vinegar being added. ^p 2. You need a controle group. ^p 3. You need to know what your labeling each container.
916	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples. Also, place a sample of one material into one container and label and after 24 hours,remove the samples frim the containers. I would have to do the mass of grams for the samples.
917	1	0	0	Make sure to include at least three pieces of information. Samples have lost in for mation because, iget information. Sample allow the samples to fit and dry for 30 minutes. ^p  Because, determine the mass of each sample.
918	1	1	1	First, would want to know what materials i would be testing in the procedure, the students do not povide a clear explanation of what is being tested. Also, how do we move the samples without touching them with our fingers, they should specify if we need to use forces to move them or not. The acids on our fingers could affect the samples, they should also describe how to figure out the mass, the way they wrote the procedure makes it so that one would not know what device to use to figure their new mass.
919	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of samples you could use, such as marble or plastic. You would also need to know how to determine the samples and to find the difference in mass at the end. Between the starting mass and the ending mass of each sample.
920	1	2	2	The additional information you would have to indicate this procedure and you need to know how much vinegar to put in the container, how big the containers are and how you determine the mass of each sample.
921	1	0	0	I think that they needed to u the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment.
922	1	3	3	Some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need, the size of the containers used in the experiment. You would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period.
923	1	2	2	Some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how big the containers where also how much vinegar I would need to put in each container. The last thing I would need to know is if i can use more than four samples.
925	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment in order to replicate it. The students chart shows the before and after results and the procedure is good, however, it does not state what the purpose is here. I think the purpose is to test permeability at the samples. You would also need to know what samples you could use.
926	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to replicate its ^p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the.
927	1	3	3	In order to replicate  the acid rain experiment, we must know more than what the group has given us. For example, in step 2 the students don't tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container. They also don't tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of. In step 1 & 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples. They don't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples. Another problem is that they don't tell us what the samples are until we see the data table, they should say it in the procedure.
929	1	1	1	This procedure is not very specific in its description. For one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples. It does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample. It also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for.
930	1	1	1	After ending this groups procedure,i have decided that the group needs to show how much vinegar is added to each container.They should also include a purpose and problem statement to clear up wh we are going to replicate their procedure.
931	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinaggar they poured on the three samples, the size of the samples, and the size of the containers. We would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did.
932	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the containers. I would also need to know how much of each sample I would need to get before testing, lastly, I would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be able to draw conclusions about my results.
933	1	2	2	The group was not very specific in their procedures. In step 1, they say "determine mass of four different samples." Samples of what? They never say. They also say to let it sit for 24 hours, where should it sit? In the light or dark? If I were to follow the procedure the group wrote, I would probably not be able to control the variables in the same way that they did without guessing.
934	1	0	0	some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis. This is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with. You would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams.
935	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to use in each contaner, also what type of container shold be used and if we're usin pure vineger or if its a solution. Lastly it would be helpful to throw if the containers were left and at room temperature over the 24 hours.
936	1	3	3	I would frustred to know where is being tested another word the specif materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment.
937	1	1	1	Some additional information that we will need in order to replicate the experiment is the materials that are needed. The other two things that is needed is that the students should write how to use the material and also how to clean up and clear everything out after experiment is over.
938	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment you would need to know the exact amount of vinegar used in each container or else the results would be different. Also, you would need to know the temperature of both the vinegar and the water you used you rinse the samples in, and the outer temperature where you let them sit for 24 hours.
939	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, there would have to be instruction on how to find the mass of ann object. The word sample should be more specific, so it's absolutely clear what should be placed in the containers. Lastly, there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container.
940	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment. First, I would need to know what type of material is being used. Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material; in sunlight? in darkness outside? I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup.
941	1	1	1	Are other information you might need to redo this lab is after what time did they messure the samples again? now much vinigar they used, and what progress the samples made inbetween.
942	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment? Why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table?
943	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup. You should also use the same mass as in the original experiment. And you would have to know how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry.
944	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information  I would need in order to replicate the experiment is,the amount of times to do the experiment, how long to let the sample sit each cycle and I would need to know the amount of sample and vinegar that has to be in each container. Also I need to know the what the control in this experiment and they need to describe the independent and dependent variable more fluent so that way, you can know what your dealing with.
945	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples, time and containers. So you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects.
946	1	2	2	In the procedure it should inclode the four samples being massed, without this knowlege the experiment would be hard to repeat they should also tell of the meathod they are using to mass the four samples, yet another thing that should be added to this procedure is what type of container to use in the experiment. These 3 changes to the procedure, will make the experiment easy for replicate.
947	1	3	3	Since the groups procedure is a little vogue, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know some additional information. First, you'd need to where to let the sample sit and dry, because that could make a difference. And you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container since that mass to be held constant. Finally, you'd need to know what are the 4 different samples to use. You know by looking in the data table, when they don't list items in the procedure.
948	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid. Their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment. And most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow.
950	1	0	0	In the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment. The students listed  everything  but they didn't give us the time they started. So you will know when to start the 24 hours. So you can drain them and let them come out.
951	1	1	1	I think that if this group that did the acid rain. Investigation should of recorded the temp. of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount , so they didn't tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry.
952	1	0	0	Four different samples ^p Pour vinegar in each ^p Place a sample of one material ^p After 24 hours, allow samples to sit out for 30 min ^p Determine the mass of each sample.
953	1	0	0	You would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for this lab.
954	1	2	2	You would need to know what samples you would need to use. How much vinegar to put in the container, say if there was any repeating the trial.
955	1	2	2	After reading the groops procedure, some information i would add is how much vinigar to put in the cup, i would also say that maibe they should have mention what the room temp should have been when they left it over night because this temp could change the results of the experiment and they really dont have a dependent or independent variable.
956	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is. Then, I would need to know what the three samples are. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use. The amounts are not specified. Finally, it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be.
957	1	2	2	In order to replicate the acid rain experiment, you would need to know specifically what four samples are being tested, how much vinegar should be poured into each container and what kind of balance/scale should be used to determine the mass?
959	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, there are some things that may need to be added to be able to replicate the expirement. In the procedure, the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass. Also, the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers. Last but not the least, the students will have to add what size should all four containers be for the samples.
960	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you will need determine the mass of four diffrent samples. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, place a sample of one material into one container a label, repeat with remaing samples, placing a single sample into a single container.
961	1	2	2	The additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment are to know what the four samples are, how much vinegar to pour in to the containers, why to rinse the samples out with distilled water, what letting the samples sit and dry for 30 minutes does, and what I will measure the samples in to find their mass?
962	1	1	1	The students in the group should have the starting mass be the same for the samples in order to give accurate results . Also to replicate it. I would have to know how much vinegar is being poured into each container. Last the amount of distilled water for each sample should be specified.
963	1	3	3	The information that the procedure is missing to be able to replicate the experiment is the size of the containers. The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use. Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment.
964	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the amount of vinegar put in each container. You need to know what the four different samples are and you need to know what unit to use when measuring the mass of the samples.
965	1	3	3	I would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on. I would also need to know the problem to this experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment.
966	1	1	1	In my opinion, they should add more informations of, the temperature because different samples migh react differently in lower or higher temperature. They should do more than just one try with each sample, It should be at least 3 to get a better data, they should have measure mass much more often as well.
967	1	3	3	In order to replicate this, I would need to know what the 4 samples this are testing for, so you don't know what to test. Also, around how much of the samples do you need? 100g or 50g or 10g. Also, how much vinegar to pour into each container. They must should be specific. They could have also added what to measure in grams, kg, lo etc. They should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in, Light/dark,warm/cold.
968	1	2	2	There are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment. First, we need to know how much vinegar to add, in order to keep the amount constant and get results like those given. What size and configuration should the containers be ? It says "identical", but does not specify anything else. Thirdly, how do we determine the mass of the samples ?
969	1	0	0	Atleast three pieces of information I would need to replicate this experiment is (1) what safety equipment should I wear? (2) The exact way to extract the samples from their containers (3) what do I need to determine the mass of each sample?
971	1	3	3	You would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use. The size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment.
972	1	2	2	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment included the starting shape and size of the sample, how much vinegar is being poured into the container and last what is being used to determine the mass of the samples.
973	1	3	3	In order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information. One piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container. You also need  to know what the conditions are made out of. The last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container.
974	1	0	0	I dont think i would add any additional information, The procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational.
975	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, I would have to know the size of its containers I use. Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in. Lastly, what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment.
977	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample. They would also need to know what containers they used. A person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment.
979	1	2	2	Without the table, a lot wouldn't be known by looking just at the procedure. First, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what four samples you would be taking the mass of. Second, you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers. Lastly, in order to replicate the experiment, the person would need to know how much distilled water should be used to rinse the materials. It would also help if it was specified in the procedure, with what should the person be finding the mass of the materials (balance?). In what unit (grams?).
980	1	1	1	The procedure did not tell the reader that they would have to record their data. This is important to replicate the experiment because if you do the experiment without writing anything down, you can't see the results as well.You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers and have it be the same amount for each sample. You might also want to include the difference between the starting ending mass in the data findings.
981	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar that get poured into containers what type of containers have vinegar is in and now much distilled water to rinse each material rilin  without much details the experiment that I would conduct would mass likely give me different results that the groups of students.
982	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be, how much vinegar to pour in the containers, how big do the samples have to be, what should the labels say on them, how much water do I use and how long do I rinse for, and how do I measure the mass ?
983	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the group of students need a control. In warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar. In the first step, the students need to identify the fast different samples that are going to used experiment on. Also, the procedure did not identify how much vinegar should be needed to pass on the samples.This additional information would make the experiment more valid as it will be will be easier to follow.
984	1	3	3	The group of students didn't specify what "samples" they were referring to. Secondly, they didn't include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers. They didn't give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step 3, or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step 4. All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment.
985	1	0	0	1. Determine the mass of four different samples. ^p 2. Instead of pouring vinegar, pour a different kind of liquid. ^p 3. Use three different kind of containers to see what happens. ^p 4. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min. ^p 6. Determine the mass of each sample.
986	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need the four different samples used, materials used in this experiment and a start time and ending time.
987	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment.
988	1	2	2	If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know how to get the mass of each sample material. I would also need to know how much vinegar you need and I need  to know the size of the cups they are using.
989	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you are using to put in the four cups, what measuring tool you are using to measure the mass of the samples, and what yourdetermining the mass of. In their procedure, it doesn't say how much vinegar they used nor the measureing tool they used. It also doesn't provide us with the answer of what they are actually getting the mass of.
990	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, a few things are missing. I would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment. By having all the mass's the same, it would be easier to determine the difference. I would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get. Also, some information such as how long I should rinse the samples for after the 24hours would be helpful in the replicn of this experiment.
991	1	0	0	If you wanted tor replicate the order then you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you.
992	1	2	2	How much vinegar to use. The temperature the experiment was conducted under. How much of such sample should be used.
993	1	1	1	Say the amount of vinegar put into each cup, how do you determine the mass ? And
994	1	1	1	How much vinegar do you pour in the four containers.
995	1	3	3	In this procedure, the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used, the measurements of how much of the sample were put into each container, the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they used. All this information is needed to replicate the experiment.
996	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it's the same amount for each. In order for the experiment to be replicated, the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabilly.You also need  have a control, which would be one of each placed in distilled water.The mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn't a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material.
998	1	2	2	One piece of additional information would be to give a specific amount of vinegar you would pour in rain container. Another would be to give the weight of each of the sample and make sure they are all the same. One more additional piece of information you could use is the size of the containers.
999	1	2	2	They need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable. They also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable. Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid. Another thing is they don't mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar. This is needed for comparison. A control (one with just pure water) is needed to increase validity.
1001	1	1	1	In these procedure it's not explained what this sample is that there putting in. So if we knew exactly what is was it would help. There should be a control with containers without vinegar to compare to the other samples with vinegar. The last thing to make the procedure right is to know the mass of each sample to know much to use.
1002	1	2	2	After reading this procedure, the students could add the amount of vinegar, in number 2, that you would pour into the different containers. Another thing the students forgot was the different samples, what are they? They need to include marble, limestone, wood and plastic into the first step. The last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end.
1004	1	2	2	One would need to know maly things in order to replicate the group's procedure. We would need to know how much vinegar was poured in each container, how much sample to put in the containers and how big the containers are themselves.
1006	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they containers the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into.
1007	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would also be helpful to know the size of the container & size of the sample to use. The process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information.
1008	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar howa you need in order to perform the experiment. Also, it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need.
1009	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much mass of each sample I would need. I would also need to know what I should use in order to calculate the masses. Another thing I would need to know is what material I am massing, they dont tell you any of that in the procedure. I also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample, because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment, but if the same amount isn't used each time then it won't be a control.
1010	1	2	2	In order to replicate the groups experiments,I 'm going to need to know how much vinegar I need, and how large of containers I need.
1011	1	2	2	Additional information that I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar they soaked the samples in and how big the containers were that they used. And I would also need to know what shape the samples are.
1012	1	1	1	The students can include the measurements of the vinegar that is poured into the cups. How much of the material they will to put into the containers. Use the same amount of mass for each object.
1013	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is that new and how much vinegar in the container then also need to specify what material to put in the vinegar and how to determine the mass of each material.
1014	1	2	2	For this experiment to be repllcated there would need to be a few added things such as what should be used used to measure the 4 different materials. Also what would those 4 materials be. It never states what materials to use. How much vinegar should be poured into cup? ^p Should it cover the material or not all the way the people performing have no idea about these things. There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water.
1015	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, additional information that you would need to replicate the experiment would be; to know how much vinegar they poured in the four containers. Explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used.
1016	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much Vinegar I am putting into the four containers.
1018	1	0	0	The additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment would be the time the example was started,the difference in mass from all four samples and determining which sample had more mass,which sample had the least. An explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
1019	1	0	0	-Repeat step 1-6 ^p -Round this data for the 2nd trial ^p -Compare the 2 trials and find the average mass for the four samples. ^p -Observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment.
1020	1	0	0	Additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure, write you need to make a data table to record information, form a hypothesis and you would need a control.
1021	1	2	2	1. What are the four different samples? ^p 2. How much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample? ^p 3. How are you going to measure the mass?
1023	1	1	1	*They have to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment. ^p *They have to measure the amount of vinegar. ^p *They have to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples.
1024	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, there is some information that wasn't involved that is needed. First, in the product it just said pour vinegar. It didn't say how much which is important. Another important factor that would be needed is in what temperature to let the samples sit and deap in, in steps, it justsaid let it dry for 30 minutes, to didn'nt sayat whattemperature. Finally, when step 4 says, mix with distilled water, it doesn't say what temperature the distilled water has, it just says distilled water. I would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be.
1025	1	3	3	I would first need to know what material the samples know and I would need to know how much vinegar. I would also need to know how big each sample should be. Also how big the container would be.
1026	1	1	1	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used. The other thing I would need so that the experiment could be valid is the time they started with, which is the starting mass. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to have o valid experiment.
1027	1	3	3	You need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers. You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in. Also, you need to know what temperature you leave the samples to sit and dry at for 30 min.
1028	1	0	0	One piece of information I would want to know is how big each piece of rock, plastics wood.
1029	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need a control such as water to compare the results to: You will need to know how much vinegar to include in the cup. You also will need to have an equal mass for equal mass for all of the samples. That is the additional information you need.
1030	1	3	3	1. What kind of samples ? ^p 2. How much vinegar ? ^p 3. What kind of container ?
1031	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample to use it is important to only vary the type of sample, rather than varying the initial mass too. I would also need to be able to  know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample. Too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically. Storing the samples, is another vital area in this experiment. The temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment.
1032	1	1	1	The people doing the lab need to stay in the procedure what matterials to use first. Also, they need to describe how to do all of these steps better so they make more sense. Also, they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure.
1033	1	0	0	First you need vinegar. You must put some in four containers then place a sample of one material into one container and label. Then after 24 hours rinse each sample with water. After that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample.
1034	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would have to know how I would determine the mass of each samples. When do you pour the vinegar in the containers. And what does distilled water mean.
1035	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment, I would need a mass scale, vinegar, containers, stickers for labeling.A watch or timer and paper for it to dry after rinsing it. I would also need samples of marble,limestones,wood and plastic.
1036	1	1	1	The information you need in order to replicate this experiment is how much of each sample you are putting into the containers. Maybe you should also state what the containers you are using look like.
1037	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information. Firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material. Secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar. Different environments could affect the date. Third, you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment. Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data.
1038	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, one piece of information i would need to know is what materials are needed for the experiment. i would  also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The students should be more specific in giving the directions well. They never tell you how to find the mass of the samples or the temperature the vinegar should be becare sawing is in. They should make sure the directions are more clear and simple directions like gather materials and clean the area at the beginning end.
1039	1	0	0	Write down the results that you come up with, record your data, weigh the samples so  you could determine what the mass is. These are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they never said to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have to guess when it should be weighed. You would also need the total of all the samples.
1040	1	1	1	How much vinegar should they put on each containers.
1041	1	3	3	Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, in the procedure it needs to be more specific and staff what kinds of samples you are using ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic) Also, it needs to say how much vinegar to pour into each cup, and what kind of cup to use. Also, how long you should rinse each of the samples with the distilled water and lastly, be more specific on how to dry the samples, should you dry it with papertowel and then let it sit for 30 minutes, or just let it sit?
1042	1	2	2	The groups procedure was missing the amount of vingar to put into each of the containers, how big each sample should be and what to weigh each sample on.
1043	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be: the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup. You would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in. Lastly, you may need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1044	1	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar put into the containers. They had only done the procedure once, to make it valid they had to do it 3 more times. They have to get the exact or the same containers to get a fair result. In the procedure it says (2) pour vinegar in each of 4 separate, but identical containers.
1045	1	2	2	After reading this experiment there is a lot I'd need to know. How much vinegar are they adding to each container, they need a control group in this experiment to rounenst results. I would also need to know what sample goes in each container.
1046	1	0	0	Make sure they start with the same mass.
1047	1	1	1	After rending the groups procedure, there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be, what type of samples I use, the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. It doesn't tell me why to do these. A final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass, instead of determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure.
1048	1	2	2	If you were to replicate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You would also have to know what  kind of environment you should leave them in and how to determine each mass.
1050	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need four samples. The sample materials should be marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Also, you would need vinegar, to pour into the containers which hold the four different samples. Additionally, distilled water needs to be used to rinse the materials, four different containers to hold the samples, and a triple beam balance to measure the starting and ending mass of the samples.
1051	1	1	1	I think that these braid made to for the
1053	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample they put in the containers. You would need to know how big the containers were. And finally, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers.
1054	1	0	0	They could have added all of it up and come up with a average and they could have come up with the mass for all of them.
1055	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know what four different samples I am getting, and how to measure the mass. What containers do I put them in? How much vinegar do I put into the containers? Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours? Do I cover the containers? How do you measure the ending mass of each sample?
1056	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know what samples to test, how much vinegar to put in the containers, and the temperature in which the samples are kept for 24 hours.
1057	1	3	3	In order to replicate group's expirament we would  need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the containers and we would also need equal amount of each samples. We would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container.
1058	1	0	0	You would need vinegar in each but 4 separate test taab's label them with what they are then wait 4 awer's and see the mass change in the object's you put into the vinegar over night.
1059	1	1	1	If I would replicate this experiment, I would add to the procedure that you need to weigh the samples before adding vinegar to them and determine the mass. I would also add that you need to calculate the difference between the masses. I would also add to the procedure that you need to add a certain amount of vinegar and should be the same for each sample.
1060	1	1	1	You would need to know what kind of material was used, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. What would happen if the samples cud not dry within 30 minutes. If you could not let them sit longer or if it was crushal that they would only sit for 30 minutes. Lastly you would need to know how you determined the mass of the samples. What do you use to measure the samples and when?
1061	1	2	2	First you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container. Also, you would need to know what type if container to use. Next the student should have put how he carried  the sample and how rinses it off exactly, in order to replicate it. Another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature washes of the solution better than another.
1062	1	1	1	Additional information needed is you would need to know is, what the mass from the camse containers when they were full. You need to know the four different samples. How many containers you need.
1063	1	1	1	1. You would need an expiremental control having just vinegar. ^p 2. No more than one trial for each sample to have precision. ^p 3. You would need to label how much vinegar would be put in.
1064	1	0	0	First additional information would be to measure the starting mass of each sample before step 3. Then after step 6, find the difference in mass of each sample. The step before step 1 should be to collect all the samples.
1065	1	1	1	I would have to know how much of each sample I would need to put in the cup. As well as needing to know how much distilled water in needed after the 24 hours, also I would need to know where to place the containers after they need to sit for 24 hours. I would need to know all of this if I wanted to replicate the experiment.
1067	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, I realised that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the name of the four different samples, you need to know the samples are _ limestone, wood marbles + plastic or the person doing the experiment would not know what the samples are. You also need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container and the size of the containers used.
1068	1	3	3	The first, most dmas piece of information missing from the procedure is the 4 types of samples you need in the expirement. You cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use. The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be. You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be. Also, the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. The amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored. For example, should they be left covered or not?
1069	1	1	1	You need to add to number 4, it should say how much distilled water, for number 24 it should say how much vinegar.
1070	1	0	0	Those pieces of information you need to replicate this experiment are from the samples in 24 hours. Pouring vinegar into four seperate but identical containers, and to allow the samples be dry, you also need to determine the mass of the samples first.
1071	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, three more pieces of information I would need to figure out are: how much water to rinse the samples with, where to place the containers during the 24 hours (under sunlight, in shade), and also what size the container is and what shape. One more piece of information we would need to know is, how many more trials to preform will all that new information I will be able to preform a more valid experiment.
1072	1	2	2	In the procedures the group should have told wat the 4 different samples where, also could add a control for this experiment. They also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added.
1073	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the students need to specify what types of samples are needed to be used to find the mass. The students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container. Accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar. Another thing the students needed to include in order for someone to recreate the experiment is to include what to label the container. Step 3 was too vaugue and it would be better to say label what material is in the container. They also should add more trials for more accurate results.
1074	1	0	0	What would need to replicate the experment is the mass of four diffrent samples, vingar, cotainers, and water.
1075	1	2	2	This group's procedure was good but some additional things i would have added was the number of samples, i determine the mass of the different samples, i believe that they also should have added the amount of vinegar they were adding to the identical containers, they also should put how much of the sample to put into the containers.
1076	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , a list of materials should be included, especially the dependent variables ( marble, limestone,wood, plastic). It is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table. Each substance (marble,limestone wood and plastic) should replace the word"samples" in step 1.The procedure should also include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variables,because some sample retain water better than others (Wood,retains water better than plastic). There is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples. In addition the students did not mention that the mass should be determined using an electronic balance measuring in grams.
1077	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment i need four different example, then i need to pour vinegar in each but identical containers, then i need to place a sample of one a material into one container and lable then take it out of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes. Finally determine the mass of each Example.
1078	1	0	0	You will need to repeat this information an over again to see how your score comes out to be and if your not satisfied then you can do it over again to see if it's right.
1079	1	2	2	In the given procedure it would help replicate the experiment if is included in it a list of what materials were used this is important  to know as well as how much vinegar should to used to pour into each beaker. If we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results. Inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples. Depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass could be found. Also it may help to have the four samples start made at tha same mass so you don't get skewed results
1080	1	3	3	The first thing is that the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure instead of just being general saying samples. They also need to tell you to find & record the starting mass of each sample. You'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs. Finally, they need to say at what temperature they should sit (room temp).
1081	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, there are some pieces of information that are not given, for example, the group does not say how much vinegar was poured in the containers. They don't state how they find the mass of each sample. Lastly, they don't give the names or amounts of each sample.
1082	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would needed to know the different types of samores. They should add that to the procedure.Another important piece of information i would need to know is the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the containers.Also,i would need to know what the control is. They don't have a control to show how the others were affected.
1083	1	3	3	The three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar, size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are diffrent it's easily affected the final result.
1084	1	1	1	First I would describe the materials I am using because in their procedure they only told us their putting vinegar in them they didn't say what.
1085	1	0	0	What type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic did they used?
1086	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing. You also need to know how much vinegar you using, you may also need to know how much you
1087	1	0	0	needed to replicate this experiment
1089	1	2	2	I would need to know the size of the container and how much vinegar I put in container.
1090	1	0	0	The information that you will need for the experiment is the results of the whole information following the dependent varable and indepennet varable.
1091	1	2	2	Three aditional pieces of information that are needed to do this procedure are how do you determine the mass, how much vinegar do you need in each cup, and they should have written the four diffrent samples in the procedure.
1092	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinager to pour into the containers, tell what the different samples are in the directions, and to be sure about the answers, perform the experiment 2 or 3 times again.
1093	1	0	0	Need to follow the procedure, also need to know them too.
1094	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedore I would need to know how to determine the mass of the different sampes such as what would I use. Another piece of information I would need to know is how much vingar should I poor into the the four identical containers, and the last thing I would need to know is what would I use to determine how much the mass is of each sample after sifting in vinegar.
1095	1	0	0	You may also use a couple of samples incase you make a mistake while you are putting that one sample in that container. You never know you can mes up.
1096	1	3	3	You would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not, as this would affect the amount of mass lost. You would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass. You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use.
1097	1	1	1	In order for you to replicate this experiment you need to know how much of the material they put in each cup. How much water you need and the amount of vinegar.
1098	1	2	2	After reading the procedures the additional things I need to know is what size containers, how much vinegar to put in the containers.
1099	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you need to know the mass for each sample if it's the same or not, you also need to know the amount of vinegar and the size of the containers. The given procedure doesn't tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers.
1100	1	2	2	Three things that should be included in this procedure is first it doesn't say how much vinegar is needed. Second it doesn't state what are the samples like what rocks they are. It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble. A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this. A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with. A fifth is that it should be stated whether or not  there is a control in the experiment.
1101	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to repeat this experiment would be: what kind of samples are being placed in the vinegar. Also you would need to know how much vinegar is being placed into each container.
1102	1	1	1	In order for myself or another to accurately replicate this acid rain procedure line two would have to be edited from "pour vinegar in each of the four, separate, but identical containers" to pour (amount in ml) of vinegar in each. This extra step will help with the validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate in order to help someone else or even them self replicate the experiment accurately.
1103	1	3	3	In order to this experiment to be replicated, I would need to know how many or what size samples I should be weighing, how much vinegar needs to be poured, what to label each container, and how long I need to rinse each sample. Only if I know these specific details will I then be able to complete the experiment like the other group.
1105	1	0	0	What we need is two determine the mass of the samples and the label and they reely need to rinse it more.
1106	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the containers. You would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material. This would allow one compare each sample effectively. In step 4, The procedure says to remove the sample. In order to replicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the containers.
1107	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment there are 3 things that you would need to know. The first thing is, you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. The second thing that you would need to know is how much of each rock sample to use in this experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what to use to measure the dryed rocks.
1108	1	0	0	What you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures.
1110	1	3	3	Additional information that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the containers at the beginning of the procedure. Also what type of containers should you put the samples in? How big should they be. Another thing would have to be how big all of the samples need to be so the results come out right.
1111	1	2	2	If I was going to replicate this expirment,I would need to know what the "samples" are,how much vinegar I need to pour in the containers and if I should measure it before I start.
1112	1	0	0	The information that I would need to order to replicate the experiment would be,what the purpose of the experiment is. They give me what to do but not what I'm looking for.
1114	1	2	2	The three thing's that I think the procedure could and should have had but didn't was the type of container to put the sample in, how much vinegar to pour in and what to determine the mass with. These things are important because if there are differet type's of container it might effect the results if one sample has more vinegar than another it will not be accurate and the mass can be done on many things.
1115	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You also need to be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample''. Also, step 3 should be switched with step 2. In order to make sense you should label things before you pour staff into the containers and this will help in the replication of the experiment.
1116	1	3	3	The procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked. First, there was no specification regarding the samples, the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested. Let done specify which suitably materials were used: Marble , limestone, wood and plastic. They also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at, As well as' the concentration of the vinegar with important  measurements that can pontentially affect data.
1117	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar  they used. How big the materials were that they used what kind of containers they were using.
1120	1	0	0	Find the difference in mass.
1121	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information I would need is the amount of vinegar used, how to find the mass, and the room temperature, in order to replicate the experiment.
1122	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment they would need an equation to work with, a table of ingredients and the conclusion.
1123	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I will need to know the size of the containers in which I should pour the vinegar, the amount of vineger and the size of the 4 materials.
1124	1	0	0	The starting mass, The ending mass, The difference in the mass, Label the samples.
1125	1	2	2	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is what material I am putting in the container. I need to kind the control group indipendant variable,dependant variable, control variable. Also what temperature they were in and what I am lableing the containers.
1126	1	1	1	They should have told what they were using to weight the materials and they should of said how much vinegar to use.
1127	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need to know the substance used as the sample.I also would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup. The starting incas for the sample would need to be identical for all other samples being used in the experiment.
1128	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar I should put into the four seperate containers. I would also need to know what temperature. I should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours. I would need to know where I should place the containers too, for example, in light, in dark place, or have it exposed to sunlight.
1129	1	2	2	I would need to know how much vinegar I was pouring into every cup. I would need to know what the samples were in the procedure. I would also need to know to record the data and take observations.
1130	1	2	2	One piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar neccessary to pour in the containers. Also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples. In order to replicate this I would need to know what samples they placed into the containers.
1131	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would need to know what type of measurement item I would need to "determine the mass of each sample". Also I need the names of the samples that I need to use, such as marble or wood. Lastly, I need from the procedure, a control because I need to be told what I am testing for.
1132	1	3	3	In order to run this experiment I would need to know what samples are being tested. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution. I would also need to know what size the container should be that I'm pouring the solutions into.
1133	1	3	3	What are the four different samples? There is no control so how do you know what water is. How much vinegar do you need to put into the containers, how big does the sample need to be.
1134	1	2	2	Some of the things i would like to know is what are the four identical containers, what are the sample, and what are they testing for exactly.
1135	1	3	3	There are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
1136	1	0	0	The group would need a problem hypothesis and a conclusion of what happend in this experment these 3 things would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are trying to figure out.
1137	1	2	2	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would need to know how much distilled water I would need and how to determine the mass of each sample. Also, how big would the cups have to be?
1138	1	1	1	The information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are a control group. Also, what are the four different samples? Another additional information would be a graph to chaw what happened and a conclusion.
1139	1	0	0	You would have to pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. Let it sit for 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water. And then allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
1140	1	0	0	I would need to know why wood did not change?Why limestone it bigger and why plastic is small number
1141	1	3	3	In order to complete this experiment I would need to have
1142	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to add what samples you are using, like marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. You would also need to say how much vinegar to put into each container, and lastly, you need to say too also determine the difference between each mass.
1143	1	0	0	Record mass of all different samples, record the starting mass of each sample, record the entry mass and the difference in mass.
1144	1	0	0	Place a sample of one material into one container and label, "repeat with remaining samples",meaning a sample into a sangle container.
1145	1	1	1	This group of students did not include many important information that was needed in order to replicate this lab experiment. One additional information they could have added was the messures in which they determined the mass of the four different materials, did they use a scale of a halause. Another additional information was the amount of vinegar poured into the contain, these students did not specify how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the outcome of the experiment. Lastly, the students did not create a control from which they can compare their results with.
1146	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was put in to each sample, find the size and shape of the container so the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample. You would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar.
1147	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment I would need four of the different mass samples and also pour vinegar in each of the four separate, but identical containers and place a single sample into a single container for 24 hours and after that remove it and let it dry for 30 min and determine the mass of each sample.
1148	1	3	3	The replicability isn't very good because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would be poured into each container so the amount of vinegar can be a controlled  variable, like 100ml per container. Also, the procedure needs to state the temperature at which the containers at for 24 hours at, so the repelilicn can have the same temperature. Also, there should be a certain amount of time to rinse the samples with distilled water, such as 10 seconds each so the samples have been equally rinsed.
1149	1	1	1	The experiment is and requires everyday materials. If I did this experiment, I would include the temperature of the vinegar and the measured amount of vinegar in each container.
1150	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment  I  would need to know what  the four different samples were, the amount of vinegar to pour in each of the containers, and I would need to know  the problem statement. I would need to know these things because different amounts of chemicals can cause different reactions and because without them I wouldn't know what I was testing for.
1151	1	1	1	Additional information I would need to know to know is how much vinegar I would need to put into each up. This information would make sure that I get the same results every time. Instead of putting too much or too little of the substance.
1152	1	0	0	Some additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment is more information how much time and hold in order to determine the mass of each sample. Also instead of containers use glass bottles.
1154	1	3	3	You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separate container, what types of container to use, and how long to rinse the samples with distilled water in order to replicate the experiment.
1155	1	0	0	To replicate this lab you would need the samples to be the same masses. Also the amount time you let the samples sit has to be the same, then you would have to remove the samples and completely clean them.
1156	1	3	3	I would need to know the certain type of 4 samples I would need to use to complete the experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so I would have unreasonable results. I would also need to know what type of containers to use in order to complete this experiment, whether it it is big, medium or small. It would also help to show the problem so I would understand what I am trying to investigate.
1157	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the student need to write in detail a hypothesis for the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusien to what those results to the experiment are
1158	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment I would need the marble, limestone, wood and plastic to be the same starting mass, That way I could tell, which one is mot effective with vinegar, easier.
1159	1	2	2	Some additional information would be,1Telling at the start of the procedur what you are using as materials, 2 tell what the three samples are, and 3. describ how much vinegar goes into each container.
1160	1	2	2	In order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information. We would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. We also need to know what the samples are for the experiment. Third, we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish.
1161	1	3	3	In order to replicate the group's experiment I would have to know more information. For example, it says to put vinegar, but it doesn't say the measurement of how much would be needed. It would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in. Lastly, the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar.
1162	1	0	0	The additional information, I would add would be what was the starting before the whole process before the eu hours occurd.
1164	1	1	1	The pieces they forgot to include were, how much vinegar did they use to test each sample and also how much was each sample used in this investigation. Also they forgot to write how long you need to leave the vinegar in the containers was in the substances.
1165	1	1	1	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is 1) To gather all the materials. 2) Tell how much distilled water, how big each container was. ^p 3) Record data.
1166	1	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar in each sample, the amount of sample poured in each containers, and in the end of the experiment the procedure does not tell you to weigh the ending sample, without this information you cannot fulfill this lab to get the data recorded in the table.
1167	1	1	1	To uptake this groups experiment I would need an additional information. I would need to know how much vinegar to add the containers, also I need to know how much of each sample to pour in the containers. And lastly I would need to know what to unlike on the containers.
1168	1	3	3	The first thing I would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all 4. Also, the procedure should saw what the "4 different samples" are ( marble, limestone, wood,plastic). Also, after placing the samples into containers, I believe the containers should be placed in the same location temperature as the others.
1172	1	2	2	To replicate this procedure, you would need to know many things. For instance, you would need to know how  big the container migt contained each separate sample were, you would also need to know how much vinegar was placed in the containers. You would also need to know how many kmrs the group repeated the procedure to know if is was accurate.
1173	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment I would need information such as the amount of vinegar used to  make  acid rain I would also need a control group as well as doing the experiment at least 2 more times to have more accurate conclusion.
1174	1	2	2	The changes they could make are ^p 1)Have an exact amount of vinegar they use in each container. ^p 2)They should repete the experiment more then one time. ^p 3)And they should make sure they have the same size of each material.
1176	1	1	1	First, you would need to gather all of your materials. That is important because you don't want to start an experiment and not have every thing ready. Second, you need measurements of how much vinegar or every experiment would be different. Lastly, you need to remind to make a control group to compare results.
1177	1	1	1	You would need the the for sample rocks ,vinegar but what we don't know is how much vinegar fore the plastic containers, put the rocks in the containers in different and then tape and label what kind of rock, then pour vinegar , leave for 24 hours to dry to used which stone is better, after 24 hours time to longer  from the container, leave stons sitting for 30 min to dry so that they can be examined (but each or that you should measure the mass of rocks in amount of viner thats being put in,then after 24 hours measure mass and record all the data.)
1178	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps. A few steps that were missing would be the amount of vinegar poured in each cup, how long to rinse the distilled water and also where to let these samples dry off at.
1179	1	0	0	-Change the amount of havre. ^p -Leave the samples to sit and dry for more or less than 30 minutes. ^p -Pour vinegar in each of for separate, but different containers.
1180	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to replicate the experiment is what the temp of the vinegar was because that can affect your results. Another thing you wouldneed toknowis how much vinegar was put into each container because that could also change the results. The last thing you would need to know is what they weighed the objects on because if you use another type of scale it could change your results.
1181	1	3	3	Some other information you  would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar you would put in each container, how big should the sample be in question 3, and how much water do you rinse it with in question4 , also  the students can describe or tell you what kind of containers to use like a dealer or a test tube.
1182	1	2	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the different samples. The amount of vinegar that each container would need. And you would have to have labeled each container in order to know what samples where going into which container.
1183	1	1	1	The group should include more information about what problem they are investigating, there is nothing whatsoever about the statement of what they are trying to figure out another thing needed to replicate the experiment would be the amount of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The students need to say exactly how much of each of these substances they used. They would also need to specify the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers so that there is and an exact, identical amount.
1184	1	0	0	You would need at least  4 containners, some vine-gar and label stickers. Also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass.
1185	1	1	1	These students should say what the sample's were that they used. For example they could say for step one that you obtained a marble, limestone, piece of wood and a piece of plastic. I would need the four sample's inorder to complete this task. Secondly I would need vinegar in four separate containers. Lastly I need distilled water for the sample's and I would need a weight measure to check the mass of all four or any samples.
1186	1	0	0	Maybe put more mass in the wood and leve it in longer than 24 years and period in for 10 mins.
1187	1	0	0	In order to duplicate this experiment, I would need to determine the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
1189	1	0	0	Well they all got diffient number of there project cause of the marbal got 9.8 limestone got 10.4 and wood 11.2 plastic 7.2 for the starting mass -5 project.
1190	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment. We would also need to know what kind of container they used. These two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original. We would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, we need to know the concentration of the vinegar.
1191	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much of the sample is put in,also how much vinegar to pour in. I would also need to know what  I am measuring the mass in,grams,etc. If I had the names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment. They also need say where to place the samples,a counter,in the sun,in the closet,they say nothing. Also the biggest of all what am I taking this for?
1192	1	1	1	The group's procedure is not very well done. In order to replicate their experiment the procedure would need more controlled variables. It says "pour vinegar" , there is no precise measurement this could lead to varied results. The procedure also lacks multiple trials. The experiment was only completed once. In order to be replicated multiple trials as well as controlled variables are needed.
1193	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup used also need to know what mas are taking the aid how range are the sample that is a using.
1194	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vine
1195	1	0	0	The reason the procedure is bad because they did not finish.
1197	1	3	3	It is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It is also important to know how long to rinse them with distilled water or how much water should be used. The group should also write in their procedure whether or not they should cover the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in.
1198	1	0	0	The procedure that is determine the mass of four different samples, pour vinegar in each of four separate, but idential containers. After of one day remove and allow the samples for 30 minutes.
1199	1	2	2	To make the procedure correct, the group would have need to tell me how much of a sample i can use or should use. Also how much vinegar i should use and the size of the containers, without that information i could not replicate this experiment.
1201	1	0	0	You are going to need marble,limestone wood,plastic and vinegar.
1202	1	0	0	You will need to do the same steps over. But you need to be safe with gougles, apnn, maybe gougles.
1203	1	3	3	You need to know the amount of vinegars you poured. The size of the containers you are using. and all samples must be put in the same areas. Because the temperature and sunlight's does changes the result.
1204	1	2	2	Some additional information I would need to repeat this experiment would be the amount of vinegar used in each cup, the how much distilled water to rinse with as well as the amount of time spent rinsing.

1223	1	1	1	First, the students should have specified what four samples to use in the first step. In step 3, the students should have told the reader that the samples were to be placed in the containers containing the vinegar. Also, it would have been a good idea to have included a step at the phd in which they would have to repeat the lab for accuracy.
1224	1	1	1	In this procedure would need to be given the names of the samples and also in the procedure they missed some vital steps like gathering the materials and also cleaning up in the end

1239	1	3	3	In this experiment, many things were not mentioned in the procedure that was crucial in order to replicate it, first was that the names of the sample were not given, so we don't know what to take the mass of. Second was that it didn't tell how much vinegar to pour into the container in the beginng of the procedure. Lastly, we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the 24-hour time period. Other than this, the experiment was written decently.
1240	1	0	0	Before the students put the objects in the solution, they should have weighed each sample. The students also should have had a control for their experiment to truly tell if their data was correct.

1260	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, I would have to know the hypothesis of the experiment, because I am ensure of what i am testing for. Also, the problem to know what I am trying to prove, and the conclusion to see what resulted from the experiment, without these pieces of information included, it is difficult to realease the experiment because you were only given the procedure and not the full lab report.
1261	1	2	2	One piece of additional information needed is how much vinegar you would put the samples in. Another would be how much of the samples? that is not specified. The last piece of additional information needed is how long do you rinse the samples for.
1262	1	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know a few more steps. First of all, they did not say how much vinegar you would need to pour in the container with the samples. Also, they must specify when you weigh the samples to get the starting weight that they recorded. Also, they did not say when to record the data you have and how you are getting the difference in mass.

1265	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need corr
1266	1	3	3	Additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment, is how much vinegar should be poured in the containers. And if it should be the same amount in all. More information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water. Lastly, information also needed is where to put the samples for the 24 hours. It doesn't say if the samples were put in different locations.
1267	1	0	0	Measure the amount, after the 24 hours. Place the 4 different samples in 4 different places temperatures and leave samples in their area to dry.
1268	1	1	1	When they are going through the procedure, they did not include the names of the tested items. They also didn't say what they were testing it for.
1269	1	2	2	After reading the procedure there were 3 things missing. The three things were hour much vinegar did you put into each, container how much water do you use to rinse each object and how long do you rinse each object.
1270	1	0	0	The mass of four different samples. ^p The time for them to sit. ^p The purpose of the experiment and wich sample. ^p Distilled water better.

1276	1	3	3	How long the samples, how much the vinegar, at how big should containers be.
1277	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know were the samples were. Some may have been warmer then others and some may have been cooler. This may have been effected the experiment.
1278	1	2	2	The group stated to "determine the mass of four different samples. Samples of what? They should have been more specific on what four samples they did the experiment on. They stated four Vinegar in each..." They did not tell us how much Vinegar to use. Also the group did not use a control group to show the difference in mass without the control group.
1279	1	0	0	What was their prediction before they start. After check if their prediction was right or not.
1280	1	0	0	To reeplicate the procudure,the additional information i would need include:Which samples of materials were placed first to last and basically in counts of even seconds, which materials were processed longer into the vinegar filled containers.
1281	1	0	0	I would add let all the samples sit in the vinegar to soak. Make sure they are dry before making on. Don't let any types get mixed up.
1282	1	2	2	The group would need to include in their proceedures how much vinegar would be used, because that would impact the results. They should also include the size of the seperate identical containers, which could also impact result. The group could have also included information about the vinegar's temp, which is an important constant.
1283	1	2	2	We need to know what the samples are in the procedure it just says to get four samples. It would also be helpful to tell us what unit to measure the samples and what size test tube to use. Then the lab would  be performed correctly.
1284	1	2	2	You would need to know what materials to use, the amount of vinegar to use, and.
1285	1	3	3	In order to replicat the expirement, the procedure must tell us what materials they use for "samples", they must tell us how much vinegar they used in the four containers, they must tell us what to measure the mass of each sample in, and how long you rinse each sample in the distilled water.
1286	1	0	0	Well Im not sure about this answer but if you want the same answer you repeat the steps in order to get the answer. But I think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck up-more because wood suck any liquid up. So it would have a different answer.
1288	1	0	0	I would have 4 container caled the 4s marble, limestar wood and plastic so the readers can know whats in the containers then poured a even amount of vinegar on each samee. Let it sit & dry out for 24 hours & deterime the mass I got at the end culd compared it to the mass I got in the begeing vig.
1289	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much  vinegar was used.It would also be helpful to know what concentration of vinegar was used. To replicate the experiment, one must know what the samples were in the procedure and the containers they were put in.
1290	1	2	2	I would need to know how to measure I samples. i would need to know how much vinegar o put in each cup should place it on in the shade.
1291	1	0	0	Hypothesis to take a guess  wether the mass of four samples 1 of they was going to be right. ^p Independent  dependent variables in the students experiment ^p Results - The would didn't have any difference in mass and had the starting and ending mass were were the same 11.2
1292	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, we should be told the amount of vinegar in m/ls and tell what the container is made of and define if there needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator.
1293	1	3	3	To replicate the group experiment you would need to know what size container the group used to hold the samples. You would also need to know how long to rinse the samples. You would also  want to know how they dried the material, if you want to get the same data.
1294	1	2	2	In order in replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the separate four identical containers, you would also need to know how the mass of the sample was examined(where type of scale) and should the sample the measure(what substance) are now indicated.All of the crucial elements stated a hour needed to marry out the experiment are not ntuing or missing not mention the lack of a control  to compare results to.
1295	1	2	2	What the samples are, what type of containers.
1296	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to be able to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar is being poured into the different yet identical containers.
1297	1	1	1	Another important  piece of information we would need to know is how much vinegar would need to be put into each cup because if we poured more vinegar into one cup and a little into another cup the results may vary.
1299	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used, how moch sample there was and what times the experiments were preformed at.
1301	1	1	1	You would would need to know how many trials to do for each sample, to make an effective experiment. You would need to know what to measure the mass in to it sound reasonable in the data. Also, you would need to pour in each of the four separate containers. All this information would help produce a successful experiment.
1302	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would first need to know how much vinegar to use. Also the amount of time its supposed to sit for. Most importantly, you would need to lable each container with the difference in each one.
1303	1	1	1	You should obtain 4 seperate containers. And then mass the container so you can subtract the weight of the container when you mass the samples. This will give you just the mass of the samples, not the samples and container combined. The amount of vinegar to add to the samples should also be determined more clearly.
1304	1	1	1	The group in this experiment can do
1305	1	0	0	You would need vinegar, a sample material to put into a measurement and label them, also you would need four identical containers. This is to replicate the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass. That is what you would need to replicate this experiment.
1306	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers. You would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in, if there was more water vapor in the air and if the samples even dried completly, you would also need to know the density of each sample and if the sample was completly submerged or if it was floating on top.
1307	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure and making of the student's data recorded, I would say that they are mostly a few total information in some for one to replicate the experiment. One such information is how much vinegar in some they used on the samples, also what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly what type of containers they used would also be useful information.
1308	1	1	1	I would need to no how much vinegar you would put into each cup, how they determined the mass and how much of each sample did they use in each individual cups.
1309	1	0	0	Starting mass, ending mass, change in mass.
1310	1	0	0	The additional information we would need to replicate the experiment would be the conculsion.
1312	1	2	2	Well first off you need to know how much vinegar to add to each container An how much of each  sample.  An what type of vinegar, I would be more specific.
1313	1	3	3	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples. I would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar needs to be added to each stare, should it be submerged or not. Also, i would need to know does tempereture play a key factor, what is the temperature. Lastly, I would want to know the acidity of the acid(aka)vinegar.
1314	1	2	2	You need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You need to know what kind of container and you also need to know how to measure the samples.
1315	1	0	0	Make a data table to record each sample and the starting mass. Also record the ending mass, and the difference in mass. Also record the lowest and highest mass.
1316	1	2	2	In order to repeat the experiment by looking at the procedure,one must know what the four samples are. The amount of vinegar for each sample should be known as well.

1317	1	1	1	With step number two how much vinegar should you pour? ^p With step number three what sample  goes with what container?
1318	1	2	2	The additional information that we would need is, how much vinegar we need to pour on each of the four separate containers. Also, it says to label the container but what are we supposed to label. Lastly, it says to place a sample of one material but it doesn't say what kind of material and in the beginning, it says to determine the mass of four different samples but we don't know what kind samples . So they should say the names of it. There is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure.
1319	1	2	2	Where do we keep the containers? How much vinegar will we use and lastly what type of wood and plastic will we use?
1320	1	1	1	The additional information that the group did not add in,  was how much viniger was poured in each container. If each container had different mass of viniger, then it will affect the out come of the samples. You must have the same amount of viniger in each container and must be done at the right time to get the lab as accurate as possible.
1321	1	2	2	One thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups. Another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long. They rinsed each sample with distilled water.
1322	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how much of a sample to test in the experiment. Also if the mass of each sample is different, for example marble being 9.8 grams, plastic being 7.2 grams and wood being 11.2 grams, how is the mass of each determined?
1323	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information. You would need to know materials,the 4 different samples are,how much vinegar was used,wether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar. Without this information our data could be different.
1324	1	0	0	Some additional information would be make sure the sample is dry to do anything else. Next, make sure you get all the data and make a chart.
1326	1	1	1	You would need to know what material the samples were made of. You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how much of each sample to put into each container.

1328	1	2	2	I would need to know how big the containers were, how much vinegar to use, and what amount of each of the 4 samples to replicate the experiment.
1329	1	3	3	To repeat the students experiment you would need to know additionaly to the procedure
1331	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you need the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass. For example, the marble starting mass is "9.8" the ending mass is "9.4" and the difference in mass is "0.4." Now for the limestone, the data the group of students got was "10.4" for starting mass,"9.1" ending mass, "-1.3" difference mass now for the wood students got "11.2". Starting mass "11.2" ending mass and 0.0 for difference mass.
1332	1	2	2	How much vinegar to pour in, how much big are the containers, and which type of scale would i use?
1333	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, it should be useful to know how much mass of each sample you are trying to start with. Each starting mass the group used were different, having a significant effect on this results. You would also want to know how much vinegar the group is putting into each container. Also, it would be important to know how the group is covering the samples from the containers. Depending on how the samples are removed could play a major role on the final results.
1334	1	1	1	For step two how much vinegar do you pour in? ^p For step four how do you remove the samples from the containers? ^p For step three what do you label the container?
1335	1	1	1	Some additional information they could have added be how much vinegar should be pourred into each container, tell how much material they used in each container, and stated if there hypothesis was true.
1336	1	2	2	1.)How much vinegar should go into each container ? ^p 2.)Why doesn't it matter which sample ? ^p 3.)Does it matter whether the the containers will affect your results ?
1338	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a few pieces of additional information are needed. You wold need to know how much vinegar is being added to the containers. You would also need to know how much of one material is considered to be a sample. It is neccessary to know how to label the different containers since they are identical.
1339	1	2	2	The additional information you would need inorder to replicate the experiment is tell how much vinegar to place into each containers, tell the size of each material such as the marble, limestone, wood acid wester.  The should also add wat the material would most likely look like after the experiment.
1340	1	0	0	Three pieces of information you need in order to replicate the experiment is a hypothesis first to predict what you think will happen. Secondly, you need the data information like what they did in the table and third you need your tools which they obviously had since they already recorded their data.
1341	1	2	2	In order for someone to replicate the experiment, this group should have immediately include, the names of the four samples substances. Also, they should include information about how much vinegar to add to each sample, and whether that amount remain constant for all 4 samples. This group also failed to inform us of the object of this experiment. When replicating this experiment it would not be clear to me the purpose of what i am doing and what i am trying to figure out.
1342	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup. You would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change. Another piece of information needed is where the samples were placed, such as a hot environment or a cool one.
1343	1	0	0	You will need to pour vinegar in four new separate, but idantical, containers. Then you will need to get four new samples. And determine the mass for four different samples.
1344	1	2	2	For this experiment you would also need to know the equipment and the four samples.What were the samples and what else did you need to do the experiment also maybe a specific place to put the sample example light, dark rooms and temperature.Should you do the experiment twice one in light room,one dark different temp.How should the containers be placed?
1345	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, i would need to know what types of mative i used as so i would need a scope to wighe the motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said repet steps 2 & 3 for each diffrent motivel used.
1346	1	2	2	Some additional information  would need to  know is what  samples i'm useing which unit i'm measuring the mass in raw much vinegar i should put in each cup this is same information i would need put isn't to evident  in the procedure.
1347	1	0	0	You need some pictures and a statement.
1348	1	0	0	1 Let the samples sit to dry for different amount of time. ^p 2 Try different containers, not identical , different size/shapes. ^p 3 Try more than  one type of acid, besides vinegar. ^p 4 Let samples sit larger than 24 hours.
1349	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample. Also you need to know what kind of container plastic, metal,paper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of. Also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such.
1350	1	1	1	To replicate the group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar and we would have to label the containers.
1351	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the additional information you would need would be how much vinegar you should pour into the four separate containers in step 2. Another piece of additional information would be mentioning the specific samples being used in the procedure. A third piece of information would be how much water you should rinse each sample with after the 24 hours.
1352	1	0	0	Well, you will need the same amount of objects to the other experiment, so it could be the same.
1353	1	1	1	You would  have to see what is the amount of rain. Also , need all the measurements  of the vinegar.
1354	1	2	2	To replicate this groups exiperiment, I would need to know how much vinegar I should use, what samples to use (incase the graph wasn't shown, then I wouldn't know) and lastly I would need to know how to determine the mass. Since I am unaware of how to determine the mass. In the procedure it should say "determine the mass by..."
1355	1	0	0	Some information you will need in order to replicate the experiment is things such as your hypothesis problem, results, conclusion, etc. You will also need to show how you got your results and conclusion.
1356	1	3	3	Initially, in order to do this expirament one would need to know which individual samples to use and what kind of samples to use. The students should have included the amount of vinegar to pour into each container so the investigation would be consistant in order for the expirament to be accurately reproduced. The students  should have included the type and size of the container, the apparatis used to measure the mass of each sample and included a list of materials for future investigations
1358	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure the additional information you need is the dependent and independent variable, central and costenit,hypothesis, and problem statement.
1359	1	1	1	The group is missing a whole in 1 of important details. I would need to know how much vinegar to use for one
1360	1	0	0	You would need to tell us how long it stayed out there.
1361	1	1	1	How do you find the mass, whatdoyoumeasureon and how much vinigar.
1362	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples, then I would sample the marble of the starting mass, then I would make sure that I have labeled of all the samples of starting mass, ending mass and difference on mass. After 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry.
1363	1	3	3	Other information
1364	1	0	0	You would to add the labels again. Then you would have to record your results yet again and then you would check you work.
1366	1	0	0	The group's procedure is wrong because they need more time on doing this experiment and if the group just work a little more harder than they did before, then they still have a chance at passing the experiment by taking out the marble and limestone and replacing them with paper or something different, then they can pass the experiment by taking some bad material out and putting new material in.
1367	1	3	3	First you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup. Secondly the amount of each substance should be the same. Next, what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide?
1368	1	3	3	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include knowing the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the containers. I would also need to know what type of containers are being used and where to put these containers during the 24 hour waiting period. Finally, I would need to know the control of this experiment in order to replicate it.
1369	1	1	1	Aluminum foil & Black paper is good to wrap around a cup because you could have one cup in any kinds of shape you want to the cup pluse using aluminum foil hold the cap real tight and the black paper you could put it wet. The alinum paper for it to look like some thing you want it to come out.
1371	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour, list of materials to use, and how much of each material.
1373	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate this experiment it must include what types of samples you need., how much vinegar to use, and you need a control to compare the results. A control for this experiment would be to have the four samples sit in water and find the starting and ending mass. The procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass.
1374	1	3	3	The procedure is missing some critical info. First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab. I would not know what I needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure. Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers. Finally the group did not say the size of the container.
1375	1	3	3	One piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used. You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup. You might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same. On other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of H.O applied.
1376	1	1	1	You would need something that measures more then measure it after the time is up there different coloured cups, so its easy to tell the different between the three cups in the same temperature because the temperature can slow and speed up the process.
1377	1	3	3	There are several things this group should have included, in their procedure. They did not specify what type of container or how large. They did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container. They did not say what to do with the container when you finish. They did not specify how  they determined the mass.
1378	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to show in order to replicate the experiment is how much Vinegar to use, & why this experiment is being done. What is the purpose of this experiment if so I would need to know the types of materials to use.
1379	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment; you would need to know: how much vinegar to pour into into each container; what utensil to use to measure the mass of the each sample; and what materials should be measured (i.e marble, limestone)
1380	1	2	2	In order to complete the experiment it would be  necessary to know what the four materials actually are. The procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials. Also it is not know  how moch vinegar to use for each substance. Lastly  it is important to know how much of each substance to use. These three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment.
1381	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what the sample of the materials is, you need to control group and you need to what you label to your containers.
1382	1	2	2	This procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment. The necessary samples: marble, limestone,wood, and plastic, are not listed in the procedure. The amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated. These are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample. Marble, limestone, wood, and plastic.
1383	1	2	2	Some additional information you would  need  a control. You would also need to have the measurements of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples. Another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure.
1384	1	0	0	Additional information that should be added and to be started with is a breif introduction of the experiment and the purpose of it. What kinds of mass, should be added in so that can cause confusion. The way I know , what were tha masses was the students data that was recorded. The procedure should also state exactly what neeeds to be recorded like starting and ending mass and the difference in mass.
1385	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup. You would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours sitting. Also you would need to know what temperature the containers would need to be placed out to receive the most erosion.
1386	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment thoroughly, one would need to know the approximate size of each sample, as a 10 inch block of wood and a 10cm block would react differently. Also, are would need to know how how much  vinegar to put in each cap and what the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples for 24 hours.
1387	1	0	0	Well think that you would need all of the same steps in the procedure to repeate it. But don't have to find the mass between each object.
1388	1	0	0	You will need the data chart also the procedure of the exprerement to replicate it.
1389	1	2	2	I want to know how the experiment is related to acid rain, because there is no introduction to describe the purpose. ^p How much vinegar would I pour into the beakers. ^p What materials do I need to conduct the experiment?
1390	1	0	0	I would need to know what the outcome was suppose to be or what it was suppose to look like. The information given is good but doesn't really explain why they were doing this experiment for, but the table was good and understandable.
1391	1	2	2	How much vinegar are whe poring? How long are we rinsing them?
1392	1	1	1	The information not included in the procedure that should be stated is the amount of vinegar added to each of the containers.
1393	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each sample. In order to get accurate results you would
1394	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, one thing they could add is to specify in the 1st step what they're testing. For example, they could have said, "determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Another thing this group could have done is to conduct more trials of the experiment so that they could get valid results. Finally, another thing this group could have said in their procedure, making it easy to replicate is, by specifying the amount of vinegar someone should put in each of the 4 containers.
1395	1	1	1	What I would add in the procedure is that  I what are the materials you need, 2 record your data, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with.
1396	1	1	1	The additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar needs to be put in each container. An additional piece of information that would help replicate this experiment is how long should you rinse each rock for because some rocks may absorb water which would add on some weight.
1397	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar would be put into each container, how much each sample should be included in each container, where to place the containers and then where to place the samples during the their in the containers and out.
1398	1	0	0	After reading the procedure, I would like to know the time given for each material. Also, if their were any color changed and what was added to the material.
1399	1	2	2	They should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well. ^p They also should  indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample. ^p They should measure the temperature at what they dried  their sample.
1400	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, additional information I would need to replicate the experiment to the different types of samples I would use, what to label the samples and what should I measure in.
1401	1	2	2	In order to replicate this groups experiments, you would need some additional information. You would need to know what the starting mass of the three objects were; You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each containers and you would need to know how long to rince each contairer after letting them sit each for 24 hours.
1402	1	0	0	You would need more vinegar and marble, limestone, wood and plastic to replicate the experiment.
1403	1	2	2	The second step should state how much vinegar is used.In step four how much vinegar is used. In step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated.
1404	1	2	2	One additional prire would be to state the materials needed nofier additional pele would be to identify how much vinegar is being poured in the container another additional peice  would be to matie all the materials the same ending mass.
1405	1	3	3	I would need to know what were the four different samples. How much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains. Also what to label the containers and should I leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours.
1406	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be. Lastly, they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking. If they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else.
1407	1	2	2	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what type of climate the containers have to be in, the size of the containers, and the thickness of the insulating material.
1408	1	0	0	Additional information you would need would be to put more time. A sample to write down the starting time & ending time, & try other samples next time.
1409	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know: ^p 1. how they got the mass of the four different samples ^p 2. A list of constants ^p 3. You would have to know how much of a sample you would place into the container of vinegar and if it's the same for all four materials.
1410	1	2	2	The additional information I would need is to know what size the containers should be. I would need to know what to label the containers. Also how much vinegar I have to put in to each container.
1412	1	0	0	Wood starting mass (g) 11.2
1413	1	3	3	If someone is going to repeat this lab the procedure should include that type of materials are used.If being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials.Also the amount of vinegar used in each container should be in there.They should also specify that types of containers are used.Maybe restain types affect the experiment and some don't and they should then made note of that
1414	1	3	3	In order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material. Moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept. Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample.
1415	1	3	3	The group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be. Another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container. The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using. Without these 3 main information points, nobody could replicate this lab.
1416	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar the samples were in,how much of each sample, and what type of containers are being used.
1417	1	1	1	Samples of what, and what is the purpose of the experiment, why should we do it, what do we have to do with the data.
1418	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate containers. Also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for. Finally, the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry. You need to know whether it should be in a cold, wet environment or maybe warm & dry.
1419	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, procedure should include the names of the four different samples, the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each cup, and the size of the four identical containers.
1420	1	1	1	In their procedures they would also have to include on how to find the difference in mass. They would have to state that you need to subtract the starting mass from the ending mass. In order to replicate this investigation it is necessary to know now much vinegar is needed in each of the containers. We would also need to know what the units are if their grams and mls.
1421	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into each of the four separate but identical containers. Also you would have to know what the sample material is that you are placing in each of the containers, and finally you would have to mass out each individual container in order to get the actual mass for each sample, and the mass of the samples to container.
1422	1	0	0	First, in order to repeat the experiment I would have to know what's there investigation about and how much of the single sample are we suppost to bot in the container.
1423	1	2	2	Some information needed is that they should tell us what the samples are, what to measure them in  and how much vinigare to use because it will change the experiment alone by not adding the same amounts.
1424	1	0	0	Don't know.
1425	1	3	3	After reading the procedure some things are still unclear. They should say what 4 samples are being tested, not just ''mass 4 samples''. Also, how much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? What should we lable the 4 containers as ? How should the samples be removed from the container ? And as always, what are the materials we need, and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety.
1427	1	1	1	One thing that they need to put in their was the amount of vinegar and what was the point of doing these.
1428	1	0	0	The three things that need to be added to replicate this experiment is to place marble, limestone, wood, and plastic each in a different cup filled with vinegar. At the beginning you need to determine the mass of a piece of limestone, marble, wood, and plastic. At the end after you determine the mass calculate the difference in mass by subtracting the first mass of limestone, marble, wood and plastic by by the ending mass of each.
1429	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. I would also need to know firstand what my samples are; I don't want to look for them in the results.
1430	1	1	1	They would also need to include how much vineagar was needed to add to the samples. They also need to include how much of each sample there should be, and that you need to find the difference of the mass at the end of the procedure.
1431	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment, the group would need to add what each sample is. They should also include at what temperature stay left the sample at and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table, so that all the information is clear.
1432	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know specifically what materials to start with and the amount of vinegar that I should pour into the four cups. I would also need to know where to store the cups. It would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well. Much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment.
1433	1	3	3	In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) What are the samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers. ^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
1434	1	0	0	You need a mearing cup the mearer the mass of energy. Then we get plastic of starting mass.
1435	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need to know is how would I find the mass of any of the materials? How much vinegar do I pour in each of the containers? What do I do to the materials or containers before I let them sit for 24 hours?
1436	1	1	1	One way they could be more clear is by  using how much vinegar into the containers. Also they can write ho to much of the different are needed and if you need  to place the samples in a certain pt.
1437	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know a few things suppos the PH of acidity of the vinegar. The surface area of the racks can also affect this experiment because the more surface area there is the more stone is in direct contact with the vinegar solution, this contact make one each dissolve faster then a rack with less of a surface area.
1438	1	1	1	a. Tell how much vinegar you used. ^p b.
1439	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of vinegar do I put in the containers how long do I rins the sample for.
1440	1	1	1	What are you going to do after you find the mass of all four samples. How much vinegar did you put in each sample.
1441	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment and make if beff you will have to have va i in more accurate information, an conclusion and a graph.
1442	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include: ^p - What kind of four samples are being used. ^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers. ^p - What kind of containers are being used. ^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers. ^p - What to label each of the separate containers.
1443	1	2	2	First of all in order to replicate this experiment you need to know what the materials are. Also the one trying to replicate the experiment needs to know the exact mass of the samples. Finally the procedure must tell the one conducting the experiment the exact amount of vinegar to use.
1444	1	3	3	To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing. How much vinegar they used, how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used. If they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment.
1445	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, it would be important that we know the specific pll of the vinegar which is acidic, therefore it would be below it. We would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment. Finally the most important aspect of the experiment that would need to be determined before replicating would be the amount of vinegar solution that each sample was placed in, the type of plastic is also important to know.
1446	1	1	1	More information that I need is what materials did they put into the containers because they did tell us, and they didn't what they did after they let it sit for 24 hours and before they rinsed the containers. Also they didn't lable each measurement on the chart.
1447	1	0	0	In order to be able to redo this experiment, you need to have all of the information. We need to know more about how they did this experiment. More details is better.
1448	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed, is how  they recorded the experiment. They need to separate that experiment more when mac. Always mineral the determine and compare it to the firod time that you did the experiment. Tell what happen how in the first experiment.
1449	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to include pieces of additional information. The group of students neglected to specify how much of vinegar that would be poured into each of the containers. When you have put a measurement in your procedures it makes it already more ideal to replicate the experiment.
1450	1	0	0	To replicated the experiment, I would need to know the time at which they began and the time they ended at.
1451	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use. You would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with. To replicate this experiment you would need to know what type of containers to use to put the samples in. The type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results.
1452	1	1	1	After adding I determined that
1453	1	1	1	The group was missing how much vinegar they used. More trials for each material would improve this lab.
1454	1	1	1	How much vinegar do you put in the cups ?
1455	1	2	2	They should describe what the samples are, how much vinegar do you put in each container.
1456	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information I would need would be the size of the samples, how much vinegar poured in each container and I would need a tripple beam before to measure.
1457	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container. Youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples. They should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples.
1458	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use, how big of a sample to use and how long to rinse each sample. Without these you cannot replicate the experiment.
1459	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of each sample that is put into the containers. I would also need to know the environment in which the containers where during the 24 hours. Things such as temperature are necessary. I would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the 24 hours.
1460	1	2	2	First, their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested. Also, they would need to specify the amount of vinegar in each container in step 2. The experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to. Without a control, we don't know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason.
1461	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to complete this experiment is this. First I would need to know which one to put in first, second how long should I wase wish water. Then finally where should I let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out. So that is the additional information I would need to complete this experiment.
1462	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers, how much material is needed into the container and how much of the samples do I need.
1463	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar should be poured in each of the four samples. I also need to know how much is the starting mass of each sample and how much is the ending mass of each sample in order to determine the mass of each sample.
1464	1	0	0	Tell us to do it again.
1466	1	3	3	In order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to. One last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar. If when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree.
1468	1	2	2	To do this experiment, you need to know what the samples are, how much vinegar to use, what do you label the containes, and how do you determin the mass?
1470	1	3	3	The students should have included information about what the 'samples' were, what type of vinegar to use and how much vinegar to use.
1472	1	2	2	I would need the types of sample materials that are being used. It does not tell me the amount of vinegar to put in the containers so I would need a measure of how much vinegar to put in. Finally, I would also need to know what type of equipment I would use to measure the mass.
1473	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, for the wood sample you would need to know the type of wood being used. Last, you would need to know the size of the container being used and how to determine the mass of the samples.
1474	1	3	3	To replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you're using. You would also have to know where you're leaving these  containers. And lastly, to replicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container you're putting these in, that and / or the size of the original sample.
1475	1	2	2	To replicate the groups experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured on the samples, as well as how much water you rinsed the samples with. You might also want to know what temperature this experiment was done in, as temp affects the results of them rens.
1476	1	3	3	To repeat this lab I would need to know what kind of vinegar they used. How much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not.
1478	1	0	0	So far in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of samples pour vinegar into each cup. Let silt for 24 hours, take samples sit and dry them. You would then received the ending mass and subtract the difference.
1479	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup. Another piece of information we need is what kind of samples they are, because if the data table was caried the water could not follow the procedure. The procedure does not state what the samples are. The last piece of information we need is what are we going to use to determine the mass after it sits fo 30 mins. It does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass.
1480	1	3	3	One thing you would need to know is what use of containers  you need. In step 2 they do not say the size of the container, they just said you need them. Also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure. Als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers.
1482	1	0	0	In order to repeat this experiment you would need an electronic balance to measure the mass, cups to put the samples in and water to distill each sample with.
1483	1	2	2	The group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using. They also need to say how much vinegar they need to pour in each container. The experiment also needs a control as evidence to show that some reaction is actually happening.
1484	1	2	2	You would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to replicate the experiment. You would also need to know how much vinegar should be put into the samples because if you use different amounts then the result may not be the same as the original. Thirdly, how large each container should be because if the containers are too small some of the samples may leak out and ruin the results for the acid rain lab.
1485	1	2	2	Although they got some information, I think that in order to replicate the experiment they would need 3 things. The first thing would be to determine how much vinegar you put into each of the containers. Secondly to determine the amount of distilled water used to wash off vinegar, lastly to determine where the samples were staying for 24 hours. If they were to replicate this experiment and did these examples that I have listed than it would be successful.
1487	1	1	1	They need to measure the amount of vinegar and only put in one container. You need to measure the mass clearly not just estimate. You get the mass before you do anything to it.
1489	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant. You will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment. Also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each.
1490	1	2	2	The students could state how much vinegar is needed in each container, explaining weather the sample needs to be submersed compleatly or not.
1491	1	0	0	After reading the group's procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need a scale, four identical containers, vinegar,  a sample of marble,a sample of limestone,a sample of wood, a sample of plastic , a stop watch, water and labels.
1492	1	3	3	In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things. What type of woods, plastic, limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use. How much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not. Also what siz container. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed.
1493	1	0	0	I think the project needs to change
1494	1	0	0	First the stat mass should of been the same. It's know a product that they did nothing to they did change, anything you can change the time.
1495	1	0	0	It didn't give enough information.
1496	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure. For instance, in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with, and specifically which samples. Also, you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. In step 4, the procedure does not explain how you would rinse the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure, can be the result of less accurate results.
1497	1	0	0	1) Gather materials. ^p 2) Pour 20 ml vinegar in each of four separate out idenical containers. ^p 3) Place a samora of the material into the container and label. Reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container. ^p 4) After 24hrs remove the sample from the containers and rines each sample with distilled water. ^p 5) Allow the sample to sit and dry for 50 mins. ^p 6) Determines the mass of each. ^p 7) Clean up where you worked.
1498	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, and I'd also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical, containers were I would also need to know how much water (distilled) was used to rinse off the samples, and for how long did the students rinse the samples, I may also need to know with what in statement the samples were massed in order to replicate the experiment.
1499	1	0	0	The additonal information youwould need to know is; you would need to know if the rock was sitting in the vingeror being shaken. If shaken, you would need to know how hard to shake it. (different prosseces are created)
1500	1	3	3	After reading this groups experiment I have found that to do this experiment over again I would need additional information  additional information would need would include what kind of container do I put the materials in,what size container was used to put the materials in ' what surface or what do I are the materials with, and how much vinegar  would I put in the If separate containers, I would  need all this information to perform of this experiment.
1501	1	1	1	In order to do this procedure perfectly you will have to know what the supplies and materials are before you begin. In order to have a valid trial of data, I would have 3 experiments for the rest of the samples.
1502	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, I noticed they didn't measure how much vinegar to pour in each container knowing the measurement will help the expirement be more exact. Another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample. Another is where should the samples sit in sun, or indoors, this may have an affect.
1503	1	1	1	The group of students didnot tell us the diffrent samples nor did their procedure tell you to find the starting mass and the difference in the starting mass and ending mass.
1504	1	1	1	You need the type of materials needed, the amount of materials in order to mix the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it.
1505	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to know in order to repeat this experiment is to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the mass of the four samples and to know what are the four samples used in the experiment. I would need these 3 pieces of information so I can repeat this experiment.
1506	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each cup, and that the amount remained constant throughout the experiment. You would also need to know how much distilled water was used to rinse the samples.
1507	1	1	1	A control variable is one of the most important things to include in the procedure and this group did not do so. The procedure should also include how much of the vinegar solution should be poured into the containers because a difference in the amount of vinegar could affect the outcome. It would also be a good thing to mention to record your information so that you won't forget it later on in the experiment.
1508	1	2	2	In the procedure, it does not tell you what the samples are, if you need to use
1510	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to know at what temperature these samples were kept. I would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount. Lastly, I feel that I would need to know what to measure the mass with. By knowing this information I would be able to replicate the experiment.
1511	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be to identify each sample. Also I would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container.
1512	1	2	2	This experiment will need more trials  to see if the results are convincing. The group  needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials. They need to add how long they rinse each sample after the 24 hours is up.
1513	1	3	3	What the samples are, how much vinegar should be added to each container, where the samples are contained for the 24 hr waiting period.
1514	1	1	1	Want wise the shops, if they wayed with the that they was holdings the thing, if it was dry, how much rinser did put in it.
1515	1	0	0	The information that you will need is the measurement, hypothesis conclusion because you want neccessarily find out what will happen next without these three things. These are the main things you need to replicate the experiment.
1516	1	1	1	You would need the names of the samples you were using.
1517	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment I would have to know much vinegar I am pouring into containers. I need to  know room temperature or temperature to see p it affects it also how long do we rinse the sample for is it in to get all the stuff off or just get it a little wet.
1518	1	2	2	The students need to have identical materials for this could validate the expirement because mass has an effect on vinegar dissolution. A quantity of vinegar needs to be specified, as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution. Finally, the temparature of the area in which the expirement is being conducted needs to be noted because some may work better in heat or cold. A constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid.
1519	1	3	3	The procedure given doesn't have enough information so that someone could replicate it. What else is needed is to state the different samples needed. It also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples. Lastly, we need to know what kind of containers (how big) each of them are.
1520	1	3	3	You would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it. You would also need to know what the specific samples were and the volume of the containers so that the experiment sould be replicated.
1521	1	2	2	Some additional infomation I would need to replicate this experiment would be a certain a mount of vinegar I would need to put into each cup, exactly what materials I am to add in each of the four cups, and also how to remove the samples from the containers.
1522	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what materials were used, the amount of vinegar that is needed and exactly how the group measured the mass both before and after the experiment.
1523	1	0	0	The students have to measure the four different samples when they remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. They have to measure before the ending mass because it may different than the ending mass.
1524	1	1	1	Additional infomation that you would need to replicate this experiment is to remember to write in the procedure to record data. Also name the four different samples you will be working with. Also make sure you work with one sample at a time.
1525	1	3	3	I would include what the samples are (wood, marble etc) and would label the containers that way. I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used. I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at.
1526	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would be a control. They don't have anything to compare their data to, they should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments. Also they didn't show the number of trials which should be more than one so they could get an average and get more valid data. The group also should have told me the amount of vinegar to put into each cup and the amount of "one material" in each cup. I have an idea how much "one material" is.
1527	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you would need to state you problem. What is the person for this lab also you need to indicate your independent and dependent variables.
1528	1	3	3	First, you would need to know what materials to use as samples. Second, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Lastly, you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at.
1529	1	1	1	Know all the materials they used and what the wight of each of the materials were before they were placed in the water.
1530	1	2	2	The amount of vinegar stated in procedure # z. ^p The type of container for each substance. ^p How much distilled water you would need to rinse
1531	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each container, how to label the containers and how long to rinse the samples for.
1532	1	0	0	Two samples of each material must be collected make two charts, one for your first trial and one for the second. Calculate the averages from your two trials.
1533	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information needed to replicate the experiment is a control because there is no control in the experiment. The type of containers needs to be known because the size can affect on how much vinegar is absorbed. Also,they do not mention how much the samples are, record so their experiment cannot be repeated with the hope of having the same results.
1534	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container. If not specified, someone may put too little  or too much, and the results can come out very differently. You would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the containers and you need to know how long to rinse each sample and where the samples should dry.
1535	1	3	3	If I wanted to replicate the experiment I would need to know what kind of containers to use, I would need to know if I should cover the samples in the containers I would also need to know what the samples are. How am I suppose to know what I am tasting if I don't know what the samples are.
1536	1	3	3	Additional information that would be needed. We need to know how much vinegar to putt in each sample, what temperature to keep sample at, and how long to rinse the samples for.
1538	1	0	0	You need to determine what will happen after the the investigation how will it happen need berck down the steps.
1539	1	2	2	To properly replicate the Acid rain experiment, you would need more information than is given in the current procedure. You would need to know what materials the " four different samples" are in step one, how much vinegar to put in the " separate, identical containers" in step two nd specify each sample goes in its own container, rather than only "plase in in single sample in a single container.
1540	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this group's procedure, I would need to have the problem their hypothesis. Also the independent and dependent variables.
1541	1	0	0	I think what I will do is to change the procedures. Instead of leaving the samples sit for 24 hours, I'll let them sit for 48 hours, I'll let them dry for 60minsand
1542	1	0	0	you would need an experiment contron, a problem statement and for precision you need more than one trial for each sample
1543	1	1	1	To replicate the acid rain experiment, the group would have to include, how much vinegar to pour into the containers, what the starting mass of each rock should be and the amount of water the samples are rinsed with.
1544	1	0	0	1. Gather materials. ^p 2. Put on apron & goggles. ^p 3. Set up materials. ^p 4. Por vinegar into a identical containers. ^p 5. Put marble, limestone, wood, plastic into their separate containers. ^p 6. Put name on container, wait 24 hours. ^p 7. Rinse the samples with distilled water. ^p 8. Put samples out to dry. ^p 9. Determine the mass & other differences. ^p 10. Clean up materials.
1545	1	2	2	Additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things. Number one used be the amount of vinegar poured into the four separate beakers.I would also need to know what is the ML size of the identical beaker of size altered or not. The
1546	1	1	1	First off, we need to know how we should be measuring the mass, like with what kind of scale. They should also specify what units we are using such as grams. They also don't tell us how much vinegar to pour into these containers.
1547	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what samples they used. Another piece of information I would need is how much vinegar do I use for each sample. Lastly, I would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer.
1548	1	2	2	In the procedure, they never said how to the difference in mass(g) and what it means. Also it never said how much vinegar to pour in each container Also they never said what of the samples were.
1549	1	2	2	One piece of information needed would be what samples to use as it is not indicated in the procedure. Another would be how much at the sample to put in the container.Also the procedure doesn't state what temperature to allow the samples to sit when they are.
1551	1	3	3	The group neglected to include what the "four different samples" are. They should have said, "use a scale to determine the individual mass (g) of four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood and plastic". They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers. They should have included how much (ml) vinegar should be poured into each container, what containers are made of. They also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to. They also never listed the materials that needed to be used.
1552	1	0	0	The way you would replicate the experiment is by repeating the procedure but just use a different sample ingredent.
1553	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what I would measure to measure the mass with a sale. Second, I would need to know to measure the mass in grams. Third, I would need to know if I should round the mass to the nearest tenth or hundreth of the gram.
1554	1	1	1	In this experiment they give all the things you need to do  but not with enough detail. In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar goes in each container. It may be the same but we need to know a measurement. Also another thing you would need to know is how to label and understand each sample,  for instance we don't know if a certain substance goes in a certain container. Lastly they don't explain how they determined the mass.  In order to repeat the experiment you would have to know what  they used to measure the mass.
1555	1	0	0	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment form a hypothesis. Draw a conclusion. Say what you are experimenting.
1556	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, some additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment is a clear indication of what the four different samples are. I will also need to know what their controlled variable was and the exact mass that went into each container. I will also need to know what amount of vinegar went into each container and if this amount varied between the different containers.
1557	1	2	2	To replicate the procedure you would also need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Second thing you need to know is what type of wood because some woods are harder than others the last thing you need to know is how much vinegar is in each asp.
1559	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know which sample is going in which container, you would need to record all of the masses of each sample and make sure all the masses are the same. You would also have to pour the same amount of vinegar on each sample.  After the 24 hours, rinseing samples and letting each sit for 30 minuets you would weigh each sample again and see which one is most different in mass.
1560	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment you waid first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses. You waid also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for 24hrs. Also, what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers, where would they sit?
1561	1	0	0	I will need to collect all of my materials. i will need four containers and my four samples. i will have to place the four samples in the containers. Then put
1562	1	0	0	If you want to replicate the experiment you will need more containers exactly alike, marble, limestone, wood and plastic, also fresh cups of viniger.
1563	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed is how much vinegar was added to each sample, how did the students figure out the ending mass, and where did they place the samples in the period of 24 hours.
1564	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment it would have been better if they put in how much vinegar to go in each container. They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container. They could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use. They could have also seen sipecific or what type of container can be used for the experiment.
1565	1	3	3	To replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know what size container to use,you would also need to know what the four different samples were. Lastly, you would need to know how long to note samples for.
1566	1	3	3	After reading this groups procedure, there are four different pieces of information I would need to replicate this exact experiment. One, the group must include what the 4 samples are, anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing. Two, you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container. Thirdly, they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know what types of containers these samples should be placed in, should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed containers?
1567	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information. First of all, it would be helpful to know how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Also, from the student's written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are. That would also be helpful. Lastly, it would be important for the student to include that at the end of the experiment that they took the difference in mass.
1568	1	1	1	In order to replicate this procedure, it would have to tell what the samples are. There is no way of correctly replicating if the wrong samples are used, which could happen without proper explanation.
1569	1	0	0	They didn't come up with the independent &  dependent variable ^p - Make up a question ^p - Create a hypothesis
1570	1	3	3	In order to figure out how to replicate this I would need to know the containers size. Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in. I would need to know how long to wash with water for.
1571	1	2	2	Some additional information that would be needed are specific things. First, the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the containers. The experiment can also describe the materials since the word "materials" can mean almost anything. The experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar.
1572	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured in the containers,you would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and you would also need to know more information on the containers.
1573	1	3	3	After reading the procedure in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of each sample  there  was. Also, you would need to know what kind of vinegar they're  using, as well as how much to pour into the container. You  might also need to know how long to rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water.
1575	1	0	0	Additional information I would need to replicate this expiriment is how to determine the mass of each sample, also to take the masses of the samples before putting them in the vinegar & to compare the masses of before vinegar &after.
1576	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment they would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container. They also need to get rid of the ''determine the mass of four different samples'' and instead say mesure the starting weight of the samples.
1577	1	1	1	You would also need to include a list of supplies, a hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar and of the samples is needed.
1578	1	1	1	This group needs a control. They need something that won't change. They also need them to have all the ^p samples with the same starting mass. Lastly i was never told how much vinegar i should into the container. ^p That is important to know because you cant guess for how much to put in.
1579	1	2	2	The temperature they were left at, know what substance the samples were, what temp the distilled water should be.
1580	1	3	3	The groups prosedure could  use, they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end. Also list the type of meteral they roused. And they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused.
1581	1	3	3	1)You will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at. ^p 2)The surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar. ^p 3)How much vinegar to put the samples in.
1582	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to come up with an hypothesis, the reason why I am doing this experiment and a conclusion.
1583	1	0	0	While doing this experiment some additional information that you may need to know are what is the reason they are doing this experiment, for  what is the problem? Another thing is what is the final anwser that they are looking for they also need to follow the scientific method in order to complete their investigation.
1584	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vingar is need and what is the purpose of the experiment.
1586	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the what the previous problem statement was, without a problem statement there is no purpose for doing the experiment. you would also need to know who the groups.... hypothesis was. By knowing the hypothesis you'll something to compete with your findings. And last the group should have said their control. ^p This will give you data to base your exams findings onto.
1587	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need is how much vinegar do you put in the containers, what are the four samples to put something over the containers, and what are steps of the samples.
1588	1	0	0	I think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal one and the lowest is. We want to add it up to see what mass is better, we need to see what sample looks good because you don't want to have a bad one.
1589	1	1	1	In order to replicate this expirement they would have to
1591	1	3	3	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be first, naming the four different samples given to you. Secondly, you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and what kind of containers. Thirdly, you would need to know how you would determine the mass (example, with an electric balance). The students need to be more specific on their materials.
1592	1	1	1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar for each samples, a control group and a dependent variable.
1593	1	0	0	When the group said to place a sample of one material into the o ther container then repeat. It does not make sense because people could repeat putting the sample into all the containers back to back. You don't have to wait 24 hours for letting the sample sit in the container.
1594	1	2	2	In order to copy this experiment you need to know what samples to use, for example list the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Also starte how much vinegar to pour or how little same with the distilled water. And what will you use to determine the mass of the samples.
1596	1	1	1	Why they are doing this exparament?  what the problem is how much vinagar is needed. What is the controll  for the experament ;
1597	1	0	0	What I would need it to maybe is to let the samples sit and dry for more than 80 minutes ^p Also multiply the last row for starting mass, ending mass, difference in mass. Be they repeat it.
1598	1	0	0	Additional information would consist of its shape, resistance and total masses lossed to complete the experiment.
1599	1	0	0	One piece of information needed to replicate the experiment would be material starting because it could or from the. Another would be how many of each sample you are puting in the cup. And the last could be if there was a control to the experiment.
1600	1	1	1	The additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is to have a control for each of the four different samples, also measure the amount of vinegar being poured and 24 hours exactly being washed.
1601	1	3	3	First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar. Lastly, i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them.
1602	1	2	2	One thing i would need is what the samples were because samples is over basic word and can mean anything. Also i would need to know what the containers looked like, so i know what kind of containers i should hecking for this experiment. Last, the procedure should add the constants for the experiment so i know what not to change.
1603	1	1	1	In this procedure I would of also mentioned weighing the rocks, I would at stated how much vinegar you pour in each container and I would of listed how to find the mass.
1604	1	1	1	Some of the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar will be poured in the containers also will need four containers a balance bean to weight it and the samples.
1605	1	0	0	The following additionnl information I would put is record the difference in mass after the beginning and ending of each mass.
1607	1	2	2	The procedure left out some information that is needed. For step three, it doesn't specify what material or what size container to put the material in. It should also tell you to do repeated trials.
1608	1	2	2	Fix this experiment, the procedure needs additional information. For example, the four different samples or how many or what kind of containers. Then it needs to state how much of each "sample". This procedure needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment gets it done correctly.
1609	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers.
1610	1	0	0	Maybe after the experiment this procedure should be done a second  time to see the results come out, the name react ways.
1611	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment  I'd need to know what 4 different samples I needed, I'd also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container I'd need to know what I'd use in order to determine the mass.
1612	1	0	0	After I had finish reading the information,I think I would need four types of vinegar but identical and four containers then I would need to determine the mass of each sample.
1615	1	2	2	This group needs to include quantitative information such as, "How much vinegar". This group should try to eliminate the use of the word "sample", it can be confusing to someone which sample they are talking about. I also think it would be better, if possible, to use the same mass for all samples, this will show the change in porportion to how much of the material.
1616	1	0	0	The additional information that you would need is the statement, why were you doing this and were the results right or wrong. Such as this the type of result you were looking for.
1617	1	3	3	You would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. You would also have to know what environment  to put the cups in, in the sun would cause different effects than inside or in a shady area. ^p Lastly, you would have to know what you put then to and leave them on a paper towel inside, or on a table, etc.
1618	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what type of samples I should use in the experiment. Just saying samples is not specific enough. I should have the exact type of material. I also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment. Should I use a lot of vinegar, or a little? 4 ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment. I also need to know how to find the difference in mass. In procedure says to determine the mass of each sample but it does not say how to find the difference which is what will solve the problem in the experiment.
1619	1	3	3	1.How much vinegar & how big a container? (Were the samples completely covered?) ^p 2.What temperature did the samples sit at? ^p 3.Rinse samples how long or until what desired effect ?
1620	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure, the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used. You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass.
1621	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular. Do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items? How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for?
1622	1	1	1	The first bit of information that you need is how  vinegar is needed in the four different containers. They never said what to use to determine the mass and they never said what kind of samples.
1623	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get. I could get any thing I saw and it would fit the description in the procedure. You also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them. You should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system.
1624	1	0	0	The students would also need to keep recording every thing they see.
1625	1	1	1	1st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample, then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all containers and try wasting 1day the 2days to see what would happen.
1626	1	2	2	The procedure does not state what the  four samples they are testing. They have to be clear and actually name them also. We do not know how much of each sample to place in the container. It should have a constant mass for each of the samples. The procedure does not state how much vinegar to pour in H2O it is very important to know the amount that they put in.
1627	1	3	3	You also would need to know how much vinegar to use, what kind of vinegar to use and the 4 different samples.
1628	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, there is much additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment. First off, you would need to know what the samples are, and what size of samples you will testing. Another piece of information that you would need would be the amount of vinegar that you'd pour in the containers (step two). From steps one and six, you are supposed to determine the mass of all four of the samples that to do this you would need to know what you are taking the mass in. (ie grams, pounds,ouples)
1629	1	1	1	The things that they could've included would be, that they need a constant, they need to specify how much vinegar is in each container and also to include the number of trials to do.
1630	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples, in other words, samples of what? One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours.
1631	1	2	2	To replicate the group's experiment, 5 other things I would need to know are: ^p 1) What samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar I need to pour. ^p 3) How much of the samples I need to pour into each container.
1634	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to know would include several things. I would need to know what the four samples of material are. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container. I would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be.
1635	1	2	2	First, you would need to know what samples are going in the cup. Also, we need to know how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples. Finally to duplicate this experiment you would need to know how much of the sample goes in each cup.
1637	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know what different samples to use. They show  4 samples in the data table, but in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing. We would also need to know how much vinegar  to put in each. Lastly, in order to replicate the group's procedure we would need to have a control variable that we could compare the results to.
1638	1	2	2	The group's procedure is missing a couple of elements. For one, they need to tell the reader how much vinegar to put with each sample secondly, they need to record the size of each sample. They need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples.
1639	1	1	1	In order to replicate the procedure, you need to know when other materials you will need, what samples you need.
1641	1	2	2	First you would name the four distrant substances, say the size of the container also how much of each substance in each container should be specified. Overall this experiment needs to be more spesific and valid for this lab to be repeated
1642	1	1	1	I would need to know what step are testing, what the independant variable is, what size be samples they are talking about. I would also need to know what other variables are controlled.
1643	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, the first thing that a group would need is a control variable. Second, we would need to know where to put the samples after taking them out of their containers. In able to complete this experiment. Lastly we would need to know what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in. In able to have the experiment preesse.
1644	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. We also would need to know how they plan to measure the mass of each sample. Another thing we would need to know before we could replicate this experiment, what the hypothesis is.
1645	1	1	1	The additional information that would be needed is a control which could be no water added, 3 or more trials to make sure that their data is valid and also how much vinegar and water was used in the experiment.
1646	1	1	1	In their procedure, the studants weren't very clear on what the samples were. If they didn't have that table, I wouldn't have known what their samples were. They also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment. So if I tried to repeat it, I could only guess the materials they used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure. The way they worded some of the steps was very confusing. They needed to make it clearer.
1647	1	3	3	The additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed what size of marble, limestone, wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified.
1648	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know some background information on the properties of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Specifically, their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples. A second piece of information you would need to know is if there should be multiple trials. Thirdly, one would need to know the effect of acid rain on the samples physical properties in order to determine a valid hypothesis/conclusion.
1649	1	2	2	The experimental procedure does not specify the amount of vinegar to be used, the mass of the samples to be used or the type of wood and plastic. The experiment cannot be replicated without this information because the scientist does not know the amount and type of materials that the group of students used in their experiment. It is impossible to know if the experiment being performed is correct if the amount and type of materials are not specified.
1650	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know about acid rain and the products you are testing, how to calculate mass, know how to compare the mass of the product before and after the experiment.
1651	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure I would add what the four different samples were for step 3 I would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps I took after step ca I would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are: 1) how to determine the mass and 2)how much vinegar to pour.
1652	1	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar that is being poured in the containers. With what am I going to measure the mass of each sample. I think that I would also need to know the problem that is trying to be solved (specifically, what am I trying to find out).
1653	1	0	0	In this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with. Also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning. But it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the Limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass.
1654	1	2	2	If you were to replicate the experiment described in the procedure, you would also need to know some additional information. You would need to know how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each cup or this could show the resulted. The procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment. It is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples, says to use the same scale for all the masses.
1655	1	2	2	To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container. You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers. Another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature, light exposure, and other factors.
1656	1	0	0	Determine the mass of four different samples.
1657	1	2	2	I would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four containers. I would also need to know where to leave the containers from temp) also, what should I remove the samples with? (tongs)
1658	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample.
1659	1	3	3	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be; and whether or not I should close the containers.
1660	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container, also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours.
1661	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container, the type of container, what they mean by a four different samples, (if not given data table), as well as the form of the rock, liquids, crushed whole etc).
1662	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to replicate the experiment is; first, how much vinegar do you place in each container, what are the samples you should use, and third what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass, those are the three things i would need to know so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment.
1663	1	0	0	I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate.
1664	1	3	3	In order to replicate the "acid rain" experiment it is essential to know what the samples are.In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples. What are the samples? Also, how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample? In step 2, it says, pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used? Also in the 4th step, it says, to rinse each sample with distilled water. For long should the sample be rinsed?
1665	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, more information is needed. It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container. It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be. Finally, to be sure the experiment is replicated exactly, it would be important to know what type of wood samples was used, as different woods have different properties.
1666	1	2	2	You would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add. How much sample to add into each solution. In order to replicate this experiment.
1667	1	2	2	One piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar. How much should you have in each container? Another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each containers for example (1in*2in) marble square.
1668	1	3	3	The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar.
1669	1	0	0	Number 2, pour vinegar in eatch of the four seperate not identical containers. This can help determen the mass of eatch item and help with the experement from what we read, after placing samples into the container then letting it sit will determen the mass.
1670	1	0	0	To determine the mass of four different samples, to pour vinegar in four seperate container. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. After 24 hrs remove the samples from the containers, allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and finally determine the mass of each sample.
1671	1	1	1	We would need to replicate steps 1-6 for samples. ^p marbles, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p What kind of containers? ^p If the containers are dry, it can change the difference in the mass.
1672	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know the temperature of the vinegar as well as how much vinegar to put in. Both of these could vary and therefore change the result of the experiment.
2788	2	1	1	Changing the type of grafin would improve the student's experiment give a better new at those data. ^P Give the names of each type of plastic type used in this experiment. Each plastic should be the same length. ^P My conclusion is plastic type held up a much stronger than all of the different types.
2789	2	3	3	Concluding from the students data that plastic type B was the stretchiest, while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment is to have described how much height to use. Another way that they could have gotten more valid results is clarify how much plastic to use, hanging of the table.
2790	2	1	1	Two ways that the stundent could've improved the experiment is by getting a more better brand of plastic or simply redo the experiment.
2791	2	1	1	A conclusion I can make from this experiment is that plastic type B is the stretchable because in trial one it stretched 22mm,while in trial two it stretched 23mm without breaking. One way the student can improve the design is by adding more weights. A second way is to include more trials so there is more to compare to.
2792	2	3	3	a.One conclusion I can draw is that plastic B stretched the most than there was plastic D, the next plastic C and finally plastic A. b. They could have used more trials. Two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment. Next they could have said how long each plastic had to be. If there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid.
2794	2	1	1	You can conclude that plastic B was the most maluble and was able to stretch the most while plastic A was the most rigid and least stretchable. Two ways the experiment could have improved was to also test for longer amounts of time, to see if time was a factor. Using different wights for different trials could also give out more beneficial data.
2796	2	2	2	Material type A stretched the least, and material type B stretched the most. Material type B stretched about 12 mm more than A. A few ways the student could have the experiment is be could have gotten different length plastic to test it different ways. Also he could have added more trials and averaged them together to get more accurate results.
2797	2	3	3	a) A conclusion about this data is that plastic type A+B stretched longer the second trial and that type C stretched longer the first and D stayed the same. You can also conclude that plastic B has greatest stretchability. B) Two ways [the students could have improved the experimental are sign is that they could have done more trials to increase validity. They also could have used the same length of different plastics each time.
2798	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B is proven to be the most strehable material because it has stricthed to the greatest length which was 22mm and 23 mm. b. 2 ways to improve the experiment is there should be 2 trials and the size of each material before being stretched should be held constant.
2801	2	3	3	a) The students concluded that platic B was the most flexible, stretching up to 23mm on the second trial and 22mm on the first. b) The student could have improved this design and validity of his lab in two ways. First he could have done the experiment a third time to further confirm results. Second, the student could have been more descriptive in his procedure explaing how to add weight to the clamp and how much weight to actually add.
2803	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that plastic B has the most stretchability. Two ways this student could have imposed the experimental design and or validity of the results is. The students could have said what the initial length of the plastic was and keep all the others plastics at the same length because if one plastic was longer than the other the experiment would be valid. And they also say how much the weights that were being used weighed because one could be heavier than the other.
2804	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be made based on this experiment is plastic type D stretches the most, plastic type D stretches the second most, plastic C the third most and plastic A the least most. The students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials. Also including what size or how heavy of a weight to use for in the experiment.
2805	2	0	0	A. Based on this student's data, I conclude that trial 2 was more effective.^p B. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is give the names of the plastics they used.
2806	2	1	1	a) In conclusion, plastic type A is the strongest plastic and plastic type D is the weakest plastic because it streched the most. ^P B) the student should have made sure all the plastic lengths were equal. The experimenter should have also tested them all at the same time to get accurate data.
2807	2	3	3	As shown in the data table, I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most in the 5 minutes.  The table also shows that plastic type A stretched the least, concluding it was very strong or had less polymers. Two ways the students can improve their experimental design would be to make sure that all the plastic samples were the same length. Another way the students can improve the experiment would be to include the weights so an independent variable can be clearly stated/seen.
2808	2	1	1	a. Based on the students data I can conclude that T2 overall had better results that T1, for T1, A, B and C were all longer than T1. ^p 3b. The student could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results by specifying the amount of weight that was added to the clamps and the student should also have specifyed the plastics that were used to make a more valid point. ^p A-10, 12. ^p B-22, 23. ^p C-14, 13. ^p D-20, 20.
2809	2	0	0	The second trail the first two numbers are higher then the two in the first trail. One number lower than the first time and the number the same, one way the could improve there experiment is they could of made a graph with there results.
2811	2	3	3	(a) Plastic type "B" is made of the stretchiest material. (b) It does not say how many or how heavy the weights added are causing the results to be innacurate. Also, the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic.
2812	2	1	1	Plastic type ''B'' contains the most elasticity. The could have explained was some of the different procedures were used for and to be more clear on explaining the procedure because when you explain a procedure you want to explain it in a way that any one can prefer in it.
2814	2	3	3	a) The plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other 3 types. ^p b) The student should be clear about the length of each plastic to ensure that only independent variable is the type of plastic. Also, the student must determine the weight of the weights clamped on the plastic to keep one independent variable (plastic type). It is important to keep your constants, constant.
2815	2	2	2	Based on the student's data it looks like they wanted to see if their type of plastic had an effect on how far it can stretch. Plastic type D must be hard plastic because for both trials one and two the plastic did not move 1 mm. The students could have improved their results by telling us how much weight they used. Without the amount of weight no one knows how much to use so our results will be different. Also, in step 1 the students did not say how long the plastic must be cut.
2816	2	1	1	I conclude, based on the data, that out of the four different polymer plastics, plastic type B was able to stretch the most mm, 23mm. Other plastic type such as A only stretched 12mm; plastic type C only stretched 13mm and plastic type b only stretched 20mm.
2817	2	3	3	A: Based on the data I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability it stretched 22 and 23 mm. C 14 and 13mm and D 20,20 mm were in between. ^p B. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything. What plastic, how long are they etc. They could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two.
2818	2	1	1	Plastic type A seems to have been stretchy because it was stretched 2mm while B and C only stretched 1mm. And type D is not stretchy because the number stayed at 20mm. The student could have used something heavy doing with tape to hold it on the table in ease it came off and they could have also used something better than a clamp to stretch it.
2819	2	2	2	A. My conclusion is that, based on the data, plastic B has the most stretchability. ^p B. The student could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial, and if needed, a fourth. The student could also have repeated the process to find out why T1 data is different from T2 data.
2820	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the 4 reaching 22-23mm. to improve this expierment the person doing the lab needs to know the weight of the weights along with the clamp that is serving as another weight.
2821	2	3	3	In conclusion, the polymer with the most stretchability is Polymer B in T1 and T2 polymer B had the highest number of mm out of the other polymers. There for it stretched the greatest amount. In the future I think it would be helpful for the students to record how much weight they used to test each polymer. I also think it would be beneficia to test more trials to be confident in the results.
2822	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is more stretchable than plastic type A,C,or D because in trial 1 plastic B stretched 22mm and it stretched 23mm. In both trials plastic type B stretched farther than the rest. a) The student could improve the experimental design by being specific with what 4 polymers she was using, the student could improve validity of her results by concluding even more trials than just 2.
2823	2	2	2	(A) I concluded that plastic type B is the plastic with the best stretchability. ^P (B) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by doing more than two trials for each type of plastic. Another way the experiment could be improved is by doing trials with different amount of weights.
2824	2	0	0	In conclusion some would strech alot and same wouldn't. They could improve it by adding more clamp or by streching it more.
2826	2	0	0	Some of the students do like measuring but also like using the data table to find out the stretched amount is in the chart.
2827	2	2	2	One of the many conclusions that can be drawn from this piece of data is that plastic "D" stretched the most and plastic "A" stretched the low. Two ways to improve this experiment is one, to add more trials, and two, describe the amount of weighs being added to the clamp. Thus piece of info is crucial.
2828	2	0	0	The two way the student could have improved the experimental design are why they put letters under plastic type is should be the type of plastic not A or B. My second way to improved the exeperimental design is the amount stretched (mm) is wrong because what is T1 and T2 where is the T3 if their three type of plastic.
2829	2	2	2	(A) Plastic type B is the stretchable plastic than type A, C, and D. ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is to make sure that each piece of tape is the same length because it may affect the stretchability of the plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is to add the same amount of weight to each plastic type because it may affect the amount stretched.
2830	2	1	1	Plastic type B is the polymer with the most stretchability. At the end of the experiment this is apparent because in both trials it stretched the most mm. Two ways to make the experiment better would be to leave the weights on for a longer period of time and also to add more weight on another was would be to make the experiment better would be to leave the heights on for a younger period of time and also to add more weight on. Another  way would be to use a double thickness of each material in evert trials.
2831	2	1	1	The conclusion that I draw based on the student's data is that plastic A streched the most. Two ways that the students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity of their results would be to test all the materials at least three times and to and to allow the weights to hang longer than five minutes. Testing all materials three times improves the student validity, because it becomes more accurate. Allowing wieghts to hang longer make it easier to see which material streches the most.
2833	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most with 22 and 23 where as plastic type A stretched 10 and 12. ^p One way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastic constant. Another way thing could improve it is by making sure that when your letting it hang to stop it at exactly 5 minutes as you can keep the time constant too.
2834	2	0	0	The students conclusion of this trial would be, plastic type 4 produced 10mm of streching for T1 and T2 produced 12mm so it increased by 2mm. Type B produced 12mm of strechability for T1 and 23mm for T2 for an increase of 1mm. type 3 produced 14mm of stretch ability for T1 and 13mm for T2 decreasing by 1mm. And lastly type D produced 20 mm of stretchability for T1 and 20 mm for T2. That's what a students conclusion would look like.
2835	2	1	1	2A)Based on the data, its possible that he's hypothesis was right, because the data seams close to each other, so there's a higher possibility rigth than wrong.  ^p 3) The could have made more trials including a control varable (one that doesn't change ) Another way as by adding more weights but do the procedure a little bat different.
2838	2	2	2	A. The plastic type B could stretch the longest at 22 and 23mm. Also the plastic type D is the only plastic that had the same length of 20mm for both trials. ^p B. Make a control having the clamp (without weight) be measured. Also they could've repeated the experiment by daily one more trial.
2839	2	1	1	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that the amount each plastic type stretched at consistent rate during both trials. ^p b) The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight was being added to the plastic samples. They could've the validity of the experiment by trying different amounts of weight with each plastic sample.
2840	2	2	2	A. based on the results, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest. In trials one and 2 it beat all others by at least a margin of two millimeters. B. One improvement they could've made is to any say length of each piece and make sure they were all equal. Another improvement could've been  to tell us the type of plastic for re-creature of the experiment.
2841	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the data is plastic type B is the longest stretching plastic used. Two ways they could have improved their experimental design / validity of their results by hanging the plastic sample in a different place, and by cutting all the plastic samples the same length because that was not stated in the procedure.
2842	2	1	1	I conclude that plastics A and C are a little stronger plastics than B and D because the both A and C stretched less than B and D. ^p Maybe 1 way to improve this is maybe wait a little longer until recording restarts because you might get a more interesting result. Another way to improve the validity of the answer to maybe test another time will get a third result making the answers more valid and presentable.
2843	2	0	0	a) A conclusion that could be drawn on their data is that on the plastic types C for T1 pool more than T2 and for plastic tyre D T1 and T2 had the same amount of stretched (mm). ^p b) They could have tested their experement out longer and they could have used more interesting materials.
2844	2	1	1	A) Plastic A & B stretched down the same. Plastic C was not that stretched down at all. B.) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment would be to measure the plastic type before stretched down. They should have had tested the plastic in different times. For example. T1 in 5 mins, T2 in 10 mins, trial 3 15mins, etc until 30 mins.
2845	2	1	1	Plastic types B, D are more stretchable than A, C. ^P They could do more trials and add more weights.
2846	2	2	2	a.) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the farthest and therefor has the most stretchability. The one with the least stretchability was plastic type A. b.) One way the validity of the results could have done more trials. Another way the test could have been improved is by stretching the plastics by hand untill they break.
2847	2	1	1	If the students test out the four different plastic stretchability then add weights to the clamps on the bottom of the plastic and wait 5 minutes, they will come to the conclution that plastic that plastic B is the most stretchable plastic B's results the first time was 22 $ the second time 23. The second most stretchable is plastic D which was 20 then 20. So in closing the students found if they put weights on the 4 different type of plastic and wait 5 minutes then repeat that, plastic B is the most stretchable.
2848	2	2	2	(A) Based on the student's data, I can concluded that the plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12mm. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm and 23mm. ^p (B) One way that the student could've improved the validity is to add more trials. Having at least 3 trials would have made this experiment more valid. Also, adding more time intervals instead of just one for five minutes would have improved this experiment.
2849	2	3	3	a. Based on the student's result, it can be concluded that plastic B is the most stretchable because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm in 5 minutes. Plastic A is the least stretchable because it stretched only 11 mm in 5 minutes on average. ^p b. 1. The student should have specified the amount of weight added to the clamp and possibly performed more trials at different weights. 2. The student should have performed a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results.
2850	2	0	0	On for in coud wont up on bown 14-13 on C the investigation be not be what A and B be. ^p A& D in not good two D bon't go up or bown so C and D is not good for the investigation.
2851	2	1	1	A) My conclusion from this expiriment is that plastic type A is flexible. B is somewhat flexible, C as well and type D isn't flexible at all. ^p B) The students could improve by being more detailed in things, like the weight of the clamp itself & including a control of each plastic.
2852	2	3	3	The conclustion of this lab according to the students, data type B of the plastic is the weakest and type A of the plastic is the strongest. For the plastic C and D, they are inbetween and C is close to A. The student could have improved the experiment by; saying the measurement of the plastic and how much mass the was on earth peice of plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is making sure the temperature is kept constant and that no one touches the plastic.
2853	2	3	3	The experiment was very precise and contained multiple trials that proved to be similar to the previous one. Plastic type B appears to have stretched the farthest but it is impossible to tell seeing there are no starting lengths. The plastics as well as the weights should have been the exact same size.
2855	2	0	0	The table characteristic property we formulate in the table because 10 +12=22 and amount stretched (mm) T1 = total is 44 and T2=600 the total att ch 9 clamp to the bottom plastic sample.
2856	2	2	2	In this experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was the plastic that was  capable stretching the most. I can tell that plastic type A was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones. Students can improve the design by having a control so that  they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable. Also, in the procedure they should tell you how long the plastic should measure, how long the length should be.
2857	2	3	3	a) Plastic type/polymer "B" had the best stretchability out of the other polymer plastics. The data shows that in "B"s both trials it stretched 22 and 23 mm farthest than any other plastic. ^p b) Two ways to improve the design are by doing more trials to be more accurate and by stating the amount of weight put on each bag (the same amount of weight).
2858	2	2	2	According to the data table plastic type B is the plastic that stretched the most without ripping. One way that the student could improve is in the procedure when it says add weights she should tell how heavy should the weights be. Also, she should tell what plastics were used.
2859	2	3	3	a. Based on the data on the table, I can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest followed by plastic D, C, then A. His results also seem precise because he did two trials and they were totally close to each other every time.  ^p b.  In the procedure, the student should have made each plastic sample the same size keeping it a constant variable. They also should explained how much weight to put on the clamps as it was omitted in the procedure.
2860	2	2	2	a) Based on the data plastic type ''B'' is able to stretch out the best compared to all other the differant plastic types. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment would be increasing the amount of trials. ^p Another way to improve the experiment would be to increase the amount of minutes it's left hanging. For example from 5 minutes to 10 minutes.
2861	2	2	2	The conclusion can be made that the plastic type B has the greatest stretchability because in both trials, is stretched the greatest number of mm in comparison to the other 3 plastic types. the student should have conducted at least 1 more trial to validate the experiment since 3 trials are necessary. For a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and constants would make the results more reliable.
2862	2	2	2	a) You can see the trails were accurate to eachother plastic B stretched the least (with the average 11mm).^p b) the student could have improved the expierement by including the ongional measure of the plastic. They could have made the results more valid by keeping the weights on longer so there would be more variation between each result.
2863	2	2	2	This investigation shows that plastic B stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment. ^P One way the investigation could be to add more trials, second, if they added more time then maybe the outcome would have changed.
2864	2	1	1	I can conclude that in trial 2 had a small impact on trial 1. The students could of improved adding the at same amount of weight to both type of plastics and keep that weights longer.
2865	2	1	1	a. Plastic B, C are almost similar but plastic D stretched the most. ^p b. Two ways they can improve experiment was by adding a 3rd trial and also adding different times.
2866	2	2	2	They could of improved it by putting their weight on them the same time and put the same amount of weight and had tried the object more than 2 times.
2867	2	1	1	Plastic Type C stretched the most in both of its trials and plastic Type A stretched the least in both of the trials. The students could have allowed the plastics to long longer than 5 minutes, incase it takes some plastics longer to stretch. The students also could have used plastics that all had the same length to begin with, to eliminate all chances of error.
2868	2	2	2	Plastic type A and B increased on the second trial while plastic type C decreased by 1mm and plastic type D stayed the same mm both trials. ^p The students could have improved the design by conducting another trial to get accurate results. The students could have been specific on the weight of the weights. For example, add 1 pound weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.
2869	2	0	0	The student could do better by describing it more how she did it and what she did, Add, subtracting, multiply, divide or something.
2870	2	1	1	a Based off the information given plastic type B stretched the most, the type D, type C, type A. ^p B. Place more weight & let it hang longer or less.
2873	2	2	2	From the data given to me, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the least stretchable of the plastics probably because of it's tight bonding. Plastic D on the other hand is the most strechable of the polymers (loose bonding). One way the student could have improved his results could have been a 3rd trial that would improve the validity. A second way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to ensure one self to have the same length plastic and time the experiment.
2874	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. In T1 it  Stretched 22 mm, and in T2 it stretched 23mm. The least stretched plastic was type A. In T1, A stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm. Type D was second stretchiest and type C was behind D. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the experiment is having a specific size of the original piece of plastic to stretch, and having a specific weight of the weight stretching the plastic. Constant keep the results of experiment valid.
2875	2	1	1	One conclusion I made is that everytime in trial 2 it goes farther than in trial 1 the numbers increase. Two ways the student have improved on their experiment is by is by being more specific in their procedure and by adding a trial 3.
2876	2	1	1	2.)At the end of the experiment i have concluded that plastic B had the best stretchability because in 1 and 2 it reached 22 mm the first time and 23 mm the second time. My hypothesis was also wrong because I had predicted plastic A would have the most stretchability but it didn't.^p (b)1.Put something heavier then weights. (2)Attach something other then a clamp.
2877	2	1	1	A) My conclusion based on the student's data is that T2 A-B held a stronger than for T1; C for T1 was the one more mm than T2 but both trials seemed out for plastic type D. ^p B) Two ways those students could have improved is if they kept the plastic the same size and shape. And if they let hang for a min longer.
2878	2	2	2	a. Out of all the plastic, plastic A is the stretchiest. Based on the data, it stretches 2 mm while the others stretched 1 mm or 0 mm. ^p b. To improve the experiment, the student could have used plastics that were all the same length to begin with. The student also, should've verified the weight of the weights they used and made alls they used the same weight throughout.
2879	2	2	2	A) In conclusion, plastic B had the most stretchability. ^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment could be to start with the same length of plastic for each trial & each plastic. The second way I would change the experiment would be to use a stop watch & be very presice about the time.
2880	2	1	1	A.) The conclusion I have drawn about the students data table is that plastics A and B where stretchable. While C actually decrease in size and D did not stretch at all. ^P B.) Two ways that the student could improve this experiment is by naming the different plastics so you know your not looking the same kind of plastic that then once. Also to add more trials because they only held two.
2881	2	3	3	Plastic type B was the most strechably polymer. The student could have conducted more trails and tell us how much the weights weigh.
2882	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic A streched the most. One way the student could have improved the experiment could be to have all of the plastics be the same size at the start of the experiment. Another way they could improve the experiment is to add a specific amount of weights in the clamp and have it be the same weight for each plastic.
2883	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest based on their data. ^p b) It could have be improved by using plastics of the same length. He also could have taken different lengths of the same plastic.
2884	2	2	2	Plastic type A was the stretchiest. The student could have improved the validity of the results by doing more trials in the investigation, and by measuring the plastic prior to the experiment.
2885	2	3	3	a) Plastic B has the most stretchability. If you take the average of the two trials plastic B, 22.5 mm, is higher then plastic A, 11mm, plastic C, 13.5mm, and plastic D, 10mm. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving a specific amount of weight to add to each clamp. Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity.
2886	2	1	1	a. My conclusion would be that the plastic type B would be better because it stretched more. ^p b. One way the could have improved there experiment design would have been leaving on e of the plastic bags, with the weights the whole time ( control) types of plastic bags.
2887	2	1	1	Two ways tat the student could have improved was to let the weights hang there for a little more time. Also use the same length of plastic for each trial.
2888	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B is the one that has the most length. ^P B) The student could had put the plastic info equal pieces and, add the same amount of weights to the bags.
2889	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most, and plastic type A stretched the least. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to specify the starting length of the plastic samples, and to specify the amount of weight added to each clamp.
2890	2	2	2	A. Plastic type A is the most durable plastic because in trial 1 it only stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 12mm, which was the least amount of stretching. Plastic type B is the most durable type of plastic because in trial 1 it stretched 22mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm, which was the most amount of stretching. The students could have improved their experimental design by stating how much weight they used for each trial because nobody knows how much weight they were using for each trial. Secondly instead of adding weight to the clamp, the should have just put the weight onto the plastic itself to get maximum stretch.
2891	2	2	2	Plastic sample C seems to be the least stretchy plastic because after testing it contracted. ^p 1. Keep plastic sizes constant for each experiment. ^p 2. Determine amount of weights added to the plastics from the clamp.
2892	2	1	1	Two ways they could've improved there expirament, would be that they couldve let the weights hang on the plastic for a little but longer, and that they shouldve used different types of bags. The conclusion was that plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other bags.
2893	2	0	0	Maybe he use the clamp to attach it before he add in the agredienta.
2894	2	2	2	Based on the data, one can conclude that polymer B is the stretchiest and polymer A is the least stretchy. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is by repeating the test with different amounts of weight that way several stretchability of the bags could be tested. Also, the students could have conducted more trials. The more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident.
2895	2	1	1	The conclusion is that in trials the student conducted it seems that in T2, the plastic stretched more than trial one. The student could change the experiment by telling you how much weight she put on each clamp. She could have taken away the second trial.
2896	2	3	3	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the most stretchable plastic. It stretched out between 22-23 mm in the two trials. ^p b) The student could have stated how many weights he/she added. He/she also could have recorded the original lengths of each of the plastics he/she was measuring.
2897	2	2	2	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the farthest with a measurement of 22mm for thal 1and a measurement of 23mm for trial 2. ^p They could have done more trials or let the clamp hang on the different plastics for a longer amount of time.
2899	2	1	1	A conclusion based on this experiment is plastic B was the most stretched to 22mm, then on the second trial A stretched 23mm. On the other hand plastic A, C and D was lower than 22 and 23mm both times.
2900	2	1	1	Out of all the four plastics, type B stretched the most. One way the student could have improved was to mention that there are four types of plastics rather than are in, step one. Another way the student could have improved was to make his/her data table more clear and accurate by adding a "time attached" column.
2901	2	2	2	a) Based on the data, you can conclude that polymer B had the most stretchability because it stretched the most trial one (22mm) and trial two (23mm). ^p b) To incate the validity of the experiment, the student could have include the amount of weight that was added to the clamp. This ways it would be added that the amount of weight was kept constant. The student also could have recorded two additional trials with more weights added.
2902	2	2	2	A.The average amount stretched for plastic type B was the most while the average amount stretched for plastic type A was the least^p B.The experiment could have been improved by both. Increasing the number of trials for every time the lab is conducted .increasing the number of times the lab is conducted.
2903	2	2	2	a)In conclusion plastic type B is stretchier that the other plastics. Type B stretched the farthest thant the others in that 5 minute period. ^p B) The students could have let the plastics be stretched untill they broke to see which one was really the stretchiest and should have added the exact same weight for all the plastic types.
2905	2	3	3	A0 I conclude that plastic type "B" has the highest amount of stretchability. Plastic B is able to stretch from 22 to 23mm. I can also conclude plastic "A" has the lowest stretchability at 10 to 12mm. ^p B) One way to make the investigation more valid is by having the length of each type of plastic be the same. Also the students need to make sure the plastic was taped the same way with the same tape. The students also need to use the same table for all four plastics.
2906	2	0	0	To improve this experiment the student should have mentioned the 4 different types of plastic if mentioned, it would give a more accurate reason as why one type of plastic is more/less stretchable than the other. Also, what the different plastics are made off. If we know that it may help us know why that plastic is, or is not more stretchy from another type of plastic.
2907	2	1	1	A) The plastics stretch about the same amount in Trial 1 and Trial 2 but the 4 plastics amount of stretch differs greatly. ^p B) The students could have done another trial or change the experiment up a little bit.
2908	2	2	2	Plastic B is stretchiest.^p Used a control and ran more than 2 trials.
2909	2	2	2	a) based on the students data trial 2 had a greater amount of stretch remained the same number of 30min in both trials. B) The student could have improved the experiment by adding 2 trial 3 to ensure accuracy. Another way the student could have improved the validity of the experiments was to record the amount of weights added to the clamp in step 4.
2910	2	1	1	a)  Based on the data, both trials have the same stretchability. ^p b) The students could have stretched both plastics at the sametime. Also record how heavy, the clamps are.
2912	2	3	3	Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most. However, the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of these results. First off, Their should be a required standard length for each type of plastic the directions could be like. "step 1" cut a 2omm strip of each plastic". Also, this experiment should specify the amount of weight placed on the clamp and this exact amount should be repeated throughout the rest of the experiment.
2914	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic B stretches the most out of all the plastics. ^p b.) two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by being specific about the length of each piece of plastic. Another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment.
2915	2	0	0	a) The plastic did in fact stretch only in to 23 mm ^p b) The student could have used more weights on the second trial, or maybe on the second trial let it beng longer.
2916	2	2	2	Based on the students data, we could see that plastic Type B was the polymer that stretched the most for both trials, they had a longer length than all of the others of 22mm and23mm. One way the student could have improved the experimental design could have been to note on the graph how long the polymer was before it was stretched.
2917	2	1	1	The plastic type D is stretched the same amount in both trials. One thing they could of improved on is they should have have 3 trials not just 2.
2918	2	3	3	(A) Based on the data shown in the experiment plastic B had the most stretchability and plastic A had the least stretchability. ^p (B) They could have improved their experiment by 1. starting out with the amount of weight for each plastic and 2. They could have performed one more trial to make sure their results were correct.
2919	2	1	1	If we streched 4 different types of plastics, then the second plastic (plastic D) would strech the farthest. ^p Two ways the students could improve the experimental design and for validity of the results are naming the plastics to know which one is which so the data will not get mixed up. Also doing more than 2 trials. Another trial might helped the data.
2920	2	0	0	Well they improved by making the right design and following the right instructions.
2921	2	1	1	Based on the results shown, plastic B has the highest stretchability. After adding weight to the plastic for 5 minutes it showed that plastic B streched the most, 22 and 23 mm. Next in high stretchability comes D, C then A. Even though this experiment was good there are two ways to improve the experimental design. I think they should have tested how different weights effected each type of plastic. I also believe that there should be a controlled group, one with no weight to compare the results of adding the weights.
2922	2	3	3	(A) I think that the plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched down the least. Plastic type B was least strongest because it went down the most. ^p (B) The student could included more trials to add validity. The student could have also included how much weight was being added to the plastic.
2925	2	2	2	a.) Polymer B has a higher streethability cuts that all the other plastics tested. ^p b.) The students can able more trials to their experiments. Also, they can clarity what type of plastic tins being used.
2926	2	2	2	a. Plastic type B was the stretchiest, while A stretched the least. ^p b 1.) Make sure the plastics were all the same length. ^p 2.) Measure the plastics during the process of stretching.
2927	2	2	2	Plastic A + B stayed stretched from the T1 and then streched more in T2. C went down so it probably gets shorter as you wear it out I guess. D stayed the same. ^p They should of added the amount of weight the attached to each plastic. They should of said how much the clamp weighed.
2928	2	3	3	A conclusion made from the students data is that different plastics' length are affected by wieght in their own ways; staying the same , growing , or shortening. The students could have been more specific by writing down how long each plastic has originally before the the 2 trials. They also could have been more detailed about how much weight ,they were adding to the plastic.
2929	2	1	1	A- In conclusion, plastic type "B" streched the most. The data says, it streched 22mm on trial one and 23mm on trial 2. ^p B- One way the student could change the procedure, is allow them to hang for 10 min instead of 5 minutes. Also they could change it up by, changing the weights every time.
2930	2	2	2	a) Based on the data shown on the table, I would say that plastic type B has the most amount stretched. ^P b) The first way is would of presented the result better and have more trails. Second it says allow them to hang fro five mins it should ve been 10-15 mins, 5mins does nothing.
2931	2	1	1	A. Plastic A is stretched the bigest throughout the experiment while plastic D shoved no change B. ^p The student could have improved the validity by adding more traits because the plastic. would have stretched larger if there were more trials and also add constants because if more things are the same throughout the experiment then the results would be more valid.
2932	2	1	1	According to the data provided, this experiment had roughly the same outcomes in trial 1 and trial 2. It's either one number higher or lower in trial 2. But, there're two ways that this experiment could be improved. One, explain what type of plastics are being stretched. Two, say how much weight is going to be added to the clamps.
2933	2	1	1	A. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest out of all. ^p B. They should have added more weights to see which would have stretched the most and which would be stronger.
2935	2	2	2	a) Concluding from the students data, plastic type A is the strongest plastic C is the least strongest, is the third, and b is the least durable. b) The student could have improved this experiment is by doing at least one more trial. They could have made a cooled and warmly the dependent/ independent variables to ran to this experimental design are vareid.
2936	2	2	2	a) In conclusion the plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. It's the stretchiest. ^p b) The student could of stretched it by two students holding both sides and simply pulling with weights on it. They could of repeated the procedure one more time. They should of had a control grap.
2938	2	1	1	A) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type A is the one that stretches the most. ^p B) Two things the student could of did to make his experiment better is, one tell us how much the weights weighed and two tell us the plastic types of polymer be used.
2939	2	2	2	I conclude that plastic type B would be the best plastic for stretchability, because in both trials plastic B is the one that stretched the farthest. In trial 1 it stretched 22mm, and trial 2 it streached 23mm. The student could have improved the validity by giving specific measurements for size of plastic so leure are all equal. The student also could have sold to use the  plastics when they were all the same day the agesa that are isn't older or weaver than another plastic.
2940	2	2	2	(A) Based on the students data a good conclusion to make is that plastic B was the strongest. ^p (B) Some ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be they should of said how much the weight weighed. Also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid. Also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results.
2941	2	1	1	a) I conclude that plastic B has the highest tensile strength. B) They could have said how much weight to add. As well as add a different amount of weight for the second trial (preferrably a higher amount).
2942	2	1	1	polymer A is a more hard and less maliable plastic which would been it would be like a 1 on 3 plastic D is really maliable and stretch so it would be a politer polymer. They could improve on the design. By may be using, more weight so they get more stretch and see its limits and way it  stretches because so polymers stretch in different directions. They would do one more trial to get more data and make it more valid.
2944	2	1	1	My conclusion is that plastic type A has the least stretchability and plastic type B has the most stretchability compared to both trials. One way to have improved the experiment design would have been to add weights and let them hang foe ten minutes for the second trial and perform more trials with longer times with weights on the plastic.
2945	2	2	2	The student could say how much weight he used. Also increase the weight in the second trial. They should also perform the trial atleast 3 times to increase the validity of the results the students must also increase the time of hanging process.
2946	2	3	3	The measures of every plastic should be the same to start. Secondly, there should be a precise amount of weights being added. My conclusion is that type B stretched the most. It was easily the longest.
2947	2	3	3	The student can conclude that polymer plastic B is the most strechability because it has the longest length in both trials.Two ways this experiment could  have been better is by saying how much weight to add to each plastic polymer and second by repeting the experiment more than twice.
2948	2	3	3	I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could have improved the  experiment design and / or validity of the results is to make sure all the plastic types start out at the same length. Another way is to have a certain amount of weights for all the plastic type trials.
2949	2	3	3	a) No conclusion can be drawn from this experiment because the length of the plastic before the weights are added we not listed. Therefore you can no see wich plastic stretched the farthest. ^p b) Two was they can improve the valitity of this experiment are 1. list the length of the plastic before its stretched and 2. state how much the weight weigh and if they all the same.
2950	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable. This is because it was stretched more than the other plastic after 5 minutes in both trials for example, plastic B stretched 22 mm in the first trial but plastic D the next most stretchable only stretched 20 mm. The students could have improved the experiment adding more trials. This would make their experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by. They should have also tell how many weights to add at a time, so that they, and whoever else does this experiment remains constant.
2951	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, the trials for each of the different plastics were very similar and showed no significant chang in how much the plastic stretched. Two ways to be more specific on exactly how much weight is to be added to the clamp. Also the student should include how big each plastic sample should be, because if they used four different size samples the results would be inaccurate.
2952	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretas the furthet out of the other three what happens to plastic. When i get low to the ground. How much weight do they put to the end of these plastic.
2953	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability out of them all. Type D has the second most type C has the third mast and type A has the least. ^p B) One way the experiamental design could be improved is by saying how much the weights weigh. Also, it would have been better if they averaged both trials together also.
2954	2	3	3	2 Plastic type B can stretch the most without bearing to.  The students could have conducted more trials (which could have improved the experimental design and validity). The students also should have specified the weights of each weights and the clamp so if someones were to repeat the experiment, they would known how much weight to add.
2955	2	1	1	a) The percentage of the amount the plastic stretched was alot lower in the second trial than in the first. ^p b) They could have done more trials. They could have used more polymer plastics.
2956	2	1	1	Plastic type "B" has the most stretchability after trials 1 and 2.
2958	2	1	1	Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic B is more durable than the rest of the plastics tested. Also that plastic A was the least durable out of the plastics. One way the students could improve their experiment is if they have at least 3 trials instead of just 2. Another thing the group could do to improve their experiment is to identify the independent and dependent variables in their procedure.
2959	2	2	2	A. My conclusion to the polymet investigation is that plastic be is more likely to stretch the longest in five minutes. ^p B. They experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to show consistency  or change in the experiment. Another way to give a  hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong.
2961	2	1	1	A. To conclude, polymer plastic B has the higest strech in meters. ^P B. Add different weights. ^P See which is more durable or stonger. ^P Clamp each differently.
2962	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B is the most flexible plastic and can stretch the farthest. The student could have improved their experiment by stating how heavy the weights were that were attached to the clamp. Right now, one can only guess what weight that was. Another way the student could have improved their experiment is by stating the original length of all the plastics, cutting them all to a certain length would improve the validity of the experiment because it would show plastic B actually stretched the farthest and did not just showed off changes.
2963	2	3	3	From the data given, I conclude that plastic B had the most strech ability and plastic A had the least. Two ways this experiments could be improved is by using the same size plastic for each type of plastic and by stating how many  he used.
2964	2	1	1	a) Two out of the four plastic types lengths increased. ^p b) First  the students should have more trials and allow the weights to hang more than five minutes on to the clamp.
2965	2	2	2	In each trial (both 1 and 2) the amount stretched increased steadily and ended at the same amount. Two ways the student's could have improved there experiment was by saying how much weight to put on the clamps. Another way to improve the experiment was, to say how far, would they have wanted the weight and clamps to be (far down or far up).
2966	2	3	3	A) Plastic sample B was the stretchiest because it's greatest length was 23mm. ^p B) They should have measured the length of the plastic before they stretched it so we can know how much it stretched. They also should have run more than two trials so we can be absolutely sure of their results.
2967	2	3	3	a. Based on only the data shown one can conclude that plastic the most stretchability out of all the plastic tested because it stretched the most during the experiment one can also assume that plastic type A has the least stretchability because it stretched the least during the experiment. One way that the experimental design could have been improved, is to have controlled the original lengths of all the plastics and make them equal. Another way to have improved the experimental design is to have included the exact weight that was being applied to the plastic.
2968	2	0	0	A. Some plastics are more strichy or maybe some of them are harder than the other brands.^p B. They could of put the time period a little longer. Also for T2 they could of put more weight than T1.
2969	2	3	3	A)In conclusion, plastic type B has stretched the most probably not the most dependable material. The best plastic type would be A. Plastic type A can withstand the most support of weight in the bag so you don't have to worry about it ripping. ^p B) These students should have conducted a third trial. It would have made for finding a better average of stretching on the plastic type. Also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags.
2970	2	1	1	The conclusion that I have drawn is that plastic type D streached the most which makes it more durable than the rest. Two ways he could have improved was by telling us how much weught was added and by telling us he averaged out the three plastic samples strechness.
2971	2	1	1	a) The total amount of T2 is greater than T1. ^p b) All lengths should be the same and every step should be equal to the others.
2973	2	1	1	The number incress for T2 most of the time. ^P Do another trial.
2974	2	3	3	A) From the table results for the experiment, you can conclude that type B was the most stretchable out plastic and type A was the strongest at holding together, the polymers and cross linking made it strong. ^p B) She could have improved the experiment by allow more trials and making sure the plastic samples were the same size and length.
2975	2	2	2	a) The polymer plastic withe biggest stretchability was type B because it stretched over 22mm. b) The students should have measured the amount of mm the plastic stretch while the clamps were still on. Also the students should have used plastics of all the same length.
2976	2	2	2	a) In conclusion, different polymer plastics do have different stretchabilities, some polymers, such as B and D , are much more stretchable than polymers such as A and C.^P b) The student could have improved this experiment by specifying the amount of weight used, and how far to let them hang. Also, the student should have specified how to calculate the amount of polymer stretched.
2977	2	2	2	a) In conclusion plastic type B in trial 1 and trial 2 stretched more then plactic type A, C, and D.^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are they could of tested more times to get better results, and they could of let the weights stay in the bag a bit longer before removing them.
2978	2	2	2	It has been confirmed accordind to the data in the table, that plastic type B can be streched out the longest compared to plastic types A,C and D. Plastic type B reached length of 23mm which is the highest length measure in the table. Two ways the student can improve there design / or validity of their results is by collecting more data and creating more trials to get a more accurate result.
2979	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, plastic type D stretched the most for both trials so that would be the one to choose when looking for the most stretchable. The first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial. The second way the student could have improved the experimental design is by making sure all the clamps and weights are the same and are hanging for exactly the same amount of time.
2980	2	3	3	a) When stretched plastic B seemed to be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic A seemed strongest. ^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with. Another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to  be added to each,
2981	2	3	3	The conclusion that can be drawn from the data done in that plastic type B. stretched the most, which was 21mm in T1 and 22mm in T2. One way the student could've improved the experiment is to add another trial. Also by using the same weight to weights.
2982	2	2	2	(a) Based on the student's data, plastic type b was more, flexible and susceptible to stretching. Plastic type A was most likely a harder or thicker type of plastic, making it more difficult to stretch. ^p (b) To improve the experiment and validity  of the results, the students could have run more than two trials so they had more to compare. They also could have included "record results" in their procedure.
2983	2	2	2	My conclusion will be that with the added weight, the plastics stretched. ^p To make this trial more reliable the student should have stated how long and wide each plastic should be. The students should have also stated how much weight should be added to the plastic.
2984	2	3	3	A: Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p B: One way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid. Another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way.
2985	2	2	2	The student's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by writing its first starting length and for another improvement they could have one a third trial to rest if their experiment is true.
2986	2	3	3	The plastic that the most stretchability is plastic B, probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other, and it stretched an average of 22-23mm. 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a 3rd trial, and using the same length for each sheet or plastic.
2987	2	2	2	a.)Plastic type D was able to stretch farther, so based on that result I conclude it was able to withstand more weight.^p (b)Two ways the student could of improved the validity of the result are use the same size of plastic for all trials and types, and add another trial to combine results.
2988	2	1	1	50% of the plastics stretched farther & the second time, 25& did worse the second time and a 5% did the same. ^p A third trial might help and explain what the if plastics were.
2989	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way that this could have improved is if the students did another trial to make sure that their experiment was valid. Another thing the students want to do is make sure they have the same size of plastic to start with.
2990	2	2	2	Is conclusion, plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched less. ^P The student could've retested a 3rd time and state wat he was trying the acomplizb
2991	2	3	3	A, In this experiment the plastic B stretched the most because it went 23mm and A went 12mm and 13mm and D 20mm. B. They could have improved there experiment by doing more trials, and have the plastics of the same lenghth.
2997	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. ^p One way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length. Another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp.
2999	2	2	2	a.) The most stretchable polymer was polymer D, where it stretched 20 mm both trials (also making it the most reliable as it's stretchability didn't fluctuate). ^p b.) One way they could've improved the experiment is by specifying what the weight of the weights added to the clamp were (and how many) to ensure that all polymers were tested the exact same way. Second, they could have a third, or even fourth trial to their experiment to increase validity of the experiment.
3000	2	0	0	The conclusion would be that the plastic in trial2 was stretchies for the most part trial 1. Two ways they could have improved this experiment would be to repeat the procedure with different plastic and put it at different temperatures.
3001	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least out of all 4 plastics, leading to a conclution that it has the worst stretchability of all 4 plastics. Plastic type B stretched the most for both trail test 1 & 2 enough info to conclude that B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could of improved their experiment by adding in the procedure exactly what was the weight of the weights they used and they could of performed a 3rd trail test to see if results were continues and never changing.
3002	2	3	3	In this experiment students tested to see
3003	2	1	1	a)According to the data shown, plastic type D has the most stretchability.^p (b)The student could have done more trials, made a line graph, and tested the plastics for different times.
3004	2	1	1	Based on the students data the amount that has been stretched finally didn't make a difference because som when up by 1 and 2 and some just shod the same. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is telling us how many weights to add to the clamps.
3005	2	1	1	After reading the data I have concluded that plastic type B is the stretches. One out of four types. I concluded that type b is the best because when you add up the numbers from T1& T2 for each number type B has 45mm. So it is the longest on.
3006	2	1	1	a. The plastic that stretched the greatest has the plastic type B. Almost more than half the plastic types had stretched more the second trial. ^p b. This student should label the names of the plastic, not just, A-D.
3007	2	3	3	The conclusion that can  be drawn,based on their data, is that that plastic type A was the  least stretchable and is the most durable and plastic type B is the most strechable and the least durable. One way they could've improved their experiment is to have each plastic type have the same amount of length for each piece because that could affect the stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be that they could've specified how much plastic should be hanging from the table so each plastic has same amount of length.
3008	2	3	3	A. In conclusion Plastic B was the best because it had the highest amount stretched for both trials in the first it stretched 22 while A,10, C 14, D 20 the second trial that it went up a mm to 23 while A,12,C,13, D 20. ^p One way they could improve the validity is more trials your experiment will only get more valid with more trials. The second way is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape, how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging.
3009	2	2	2	A) In conclusion, my hypothesis was right. The plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that the weight was hanging on it. The independent variable was the plastic and the dependent variable was the weight.^p B) The students could have improved the experimental design by having the weight the same for every trial. Also there should have been more than two trials.
3010	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D was able to stretch themost out of all of the plastics. The two things these students would have done to improve ther validity and experimental design is they could have used more trials and they also could have used a control
3011	2	0	0	Plastic type A was the strongest. The student could have made it before and after instead of Trial 1 and Trial 2. They also could have named the different type of plastics.
3013	2	3	3	The data provided concludes that plastic type "B" stretched the most. One way the student could improve the validity of this experiment would be to state the weight of the weights that are to be added onto the pieces of plastic. One thing the student also should have done was to have recorded the original lengths of the plastic samples so you could see just how much the pieces of plastic streched from their original lengths.
3014	2	2	2	In conclusion, the students data table is base on that plastic type B in both trail had most streched. The students could have improve more if they add other trail and added on control.
3015	2	0	0	For one the student could of use two wheights instead of one. And also use a diferent method for example instead of hanging the bowls from the table hang them up from a high place.
3016	2	1	1	Plastic D has no stretchability. It stayed the same both trial kinds. ^P The students could of improved there experiment by putting a time for trial 2. Also giving an exact amount of weight that should be added to the plastic.
3017	2	3	3	Based on the students data; plastic type B has the highest stretchability at 45mm stretched, while plastic type A would be the worst at only 22mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their data are, one; They could say how heavy the weights were and maybe allowed them to hang on the clamps for more than 5 minutes. Two; They could have had more than 2 trials.
3018	2	2	2	Based on the student's data I can tell that plastic type B was the most stretchable. I see this because in his results plastic B had the greatest amount in milimeters stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results was by giving the initial length of the plastics and each plastic should have had a constant length.
3019	2	0	0	Conclusion, the tape has stretched more because of the weight level has a high level of density. To improve, they should make a bar graph.
3020	2	1	1	a) A conclusion based on the student's data that I can draw is the Plastic all stayed around. The same amount stretched from T1 to T2 if any thing it was 1mm or 2mm of the first TI. ^P B) Two way the students could have improved the experiment design/or validity of the results was to do more than one way to stretch the bags, and to do 3 trails each.
3022	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B is the most amount stretched and plastic type A was the least amount stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is be more informative on the size sample you must take. Also the amount of weights you add one.
3023	2	2	2	In conclusion to the student's expirements, each plastic had stretched more or less the same amount of the first trial. Plastic B was the most stretchable. An improvement the students should have made was make each piece of plastic the same length before stretching. The students could have improved the validity by showing the length of the plastic before it was stretched to measure exactly which plastic stretched more.
3024	2	0	0	The two ways the student could have improved experimental design out/or validity of the results are.Procedure:4) Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.If you do that you doing to know plastics is stronge and can carry a havy thing. 5) Remove the weight and camp and measure the length of the plastic types. After you remove the weights and cound how many weight they can early stuff in the plastic.
3025	2	1	1	A conclusion drawn is that the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial. The students could have included a diagram to give a better picture of how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials. So the students should have done another trial and drawn a diagram.
3026	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B was consistently the stretchiest of all the plastic types used in the experiment. One possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial. The procedure does not tell in how much weight must be applied and thus a person may apply uneven amounts of weight dipending on the trial and plastic. This would cause the experiment to have the uniformity of its data in the fact that the weight was not constant. Also, the student could have improved the experimental design by adding more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more accurate.
3027	2	3	3	According to the data table it looks like the plastic type B was stretched the most and plastic A was stretched the best. B. One way the experiment could have improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic was before the weights were on it. Another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic.
3028	2	1	1	Based on the data  shown, plastic type 'D' seems to be the most durable. The table shows that it did not stretch. The student could have improved validity by doing more trials, and repeating the experiment more than once incase any error wes made during the first run through of the test.
3030	2	2	2	a) The conclusion is that plastic type A streched the least (11mm) compared to the other plastics. Plastic type B stretches the most (22.5). ^P b) Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment was to do at least three trials to get a more accurate results. Another way could have been streching the plastics for more than five minutes, to make the results more accurate.
3031	2	1	1	A) The data from this investigation shows that the plastic stretched the furthest was type B Next was type D, then type C, and finally type A. The information shows they did two trails to make sure they have correct information.^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment design was to make steps and to explain the procedure more. Next, I would say to make a graph would be the best way to further improve these results.
3032	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that plasic D has the most stretchability. One way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant. For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic. Another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to. For instance one plastic with no weight.
3033	2	2	2	I think that plastic type B is the best because it stretched the farthest in both trials. ^p They should've been more specific with whic four types of plastics they should have used and they should have said exactly how many weights to put on it.
3034	2	3	3	b. The student should use all sample plastics of the same length so the strength and stretchability can be determined. The student should have also done atleast one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error. ^p a. From the experiment, plastic type B came to be the most stretchable. Plastic type D was also very stretchable and the second stretchiest, plastic type C came after B, and after C, came plastic type A. Plastic A was the strongest but plastic B was the stretchiest.
3035	2	1	1	A. In conclusion based on the students data, T1's plastics where a little bit weaker the T2's. ^p (B) One way a student could have im proved the experiment is by adding more length to the plastics. ^p Another way to improve the experiment is by trying more trials.
3036	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with 22, and 23 mm in their trials respectively. However, the student cold've recorded the starting length and the difference in length, as from this data the reader doesn't know if these results are comparative. In the procedure, the first step is measuring the length, but i don't see that data. Another improvement wold be more trials.
3037	2	3	3	a) The students conclusion is that although plastic D was the most accurate, plastic B stretched the most for both trials. ^p b) The procedure does not say the amount / what unit of weight was added. The plastics also must all be the same length.
3038	2	3	3	One conclusion that can be based off the student's data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all of the plastics tested.One way this student can improve the experimental design is to add more trials to the experiment. Another way is to set the length the plastic should be because having different plastic lengths can cause experimental error.
3039	2	2	2	In conclusion, plastic B stretched the most (22 & 23 mm) and plastic A stretched the least (10 & 12 mm). ^p One way to help improve the experiment is to have a constant, which would be each plastic with out any weights. Another way to help improve this experiment is to specify how much weight should be added to the clamp.
3040	2	3	3	a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. On the first trial plastic type B stretched 22mm while plastic C only stretched 14mm. On the second trial plastic B stretched 23mm and the next closes was plastic type D which stretched 20mm. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to do more trials and when the students are starting the experiment tell me how long the plastic is before you start to stretch it.
3041	2	0	0	Plastic type (A) stretched (2in) and plastic type (D) it didn't stretched at all.
3042	2	0	0	The conclusion I have come to base off of the students data is that the most durable plastic strength base is (1). I know this to be true because there is no length difference between T1 & T2.
3043	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretch 10 (mm) on the first trial and 12 on the second. Type B stretched 22 (mm) on the first and 23 on the second.  Type C stretched 14 (mm) on the first trial and 13 on the second.  Type D stretched 20 (mm) on the first trial and the same amount on the second. I can conclude that type B has the most stretchability because it stretched 22(mm) on the first trail and 23(mm) on the second trail. Two way to improve is to add a trail and try different amounts of weights.
3044	2	2	2	A conclusion for this lab could be that plastic type B stretched the most because it is thin and that type A streched the least because it is the thickest. A way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics. Also to say how much weight to the clamp.
3045	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of them all, for both trials 1 and 2. I think they could have explained it more so that I could have a better mental image of it. I also think they should have said how much weight they added the the clamps.
3046	2	2	2	a. Based on the students data you can tell the plastic did not stretch too much. most of the plastics ended up stretching 1-2 mm. For example, plastic a went from stretching at 10mm-12mm, on the other hand plastic C decreased 1mm and went from 14mm-13mm plastic D didn't stretch within both trials. ^p To improve their experiment the student could have recorded how long the bag was before weights were placed on them and they could have also said how much did the wights have to weigh in order to keep how much the bag stretched constant.
3047	2	0	0	The conclusion I get on this students data is that all the plastics have been weighed and been measured. But as they did the 2trial the data changed and for plastic type D its weight and length was the same it means that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same.
3048	2	3	3	a)The conclusion that I could base is that plastic type B in both trials had stretched the longest.^p (b)Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design is by letting us know how many weights put in each cup. Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well.
3049	2	1	1	(A)My conclusion on the student data table is that plastic D was the strongest. It stretch up to 20 mm in both trials.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improve was to make a 3 trial or test and to be able to measure the abravasion of the plastic types.
3050	2	1	1	After experimenting which plastic was more pliant, the conclusion was made that plastic type B was the most stretchable in, both, trial A and trial B. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are changing step 7 and making it less vague and say specifically re do steps 1-6 for a second trial, etc. The student could be sure to time each trial for accurate validity.
3052	2	2	2	It can be concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest because it had the highest average and much stretched of 22.5 mm. Two ways the students would have improved their experimental design are that they should've included how much weight. The weight was and how many clamps to use. Also, they should've used a control plastic to compare their results to.
3053	2	2	2	One conclusion I ran make is plastic B was best of stretchability. And students could have made this expiriment better by making sure the plastics were the same starting size. Another way is they could have added another column to show at what sise the plastic was before the expiriment so that you can see how much the plastic stretched.
3054	2	3	3	A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm. 11mm more than plastic type A, 10mm more than plastic type c, 3mm more than the stretchability of plastic type D. By having more improved trials. They should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width. and they could have tested more types of plastics.
3055	2	3	3	(a) Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p (b) One way the student could improve is by making sure the plastic strips are all the same length+ hanging off the table from the same point. Another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip. This would provide a constant to compare the results to.
3056	2	1	1	This experiment didn't seem to work out very well. Judging by the data table, the experiment didn't seem to prove anything. There are no significant changes in the lengths of the plastics. The first three steps of the experiment are good, but rather than removing the weights, the student should just keep adding more and more weights until the plastic, finally stops. That would really show how much the plastic could stretch. Another way to improve the experiment is to conduct a third trial. An experiment is more, valid when there are more and more trials.
3057	2	1	1	A.) Plastic type 2 had more stretchability then all the other plastics tested. ^p B>) The student could have improved the test by saying how much weights was added during the experiment. The student could have also discribed the rate at which to add the weights for consistancy.
3059	2	3	3	According to the data, plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched 22mm in trial one, and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p One way the students could have improved the validity of the experiment would be to not just add weights to the plastic like in the procedure, but put the same amount of weight on the plastic each time. Another problem would be if the plastic wasn't taped at the same distance from the edge and if they are using a new set of the same plastic for their second trial.
3060	2	1	1	Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to added different weights to see how much long the plastic could stretch until it trips. Another is to do more than two trial to make more reliable.
3061	2	2	2	a) Plastic type "B" has the greatest stretchability amoung the four types of plastic. In the first trial it stretched 20mm, and in the second trial it stretched 23mm. Plastic type "A" has the worst stretchability. In (T1) it stretched 10mm, and in (T2) it stretched 12mm.^p b.) Adding many more trials, and by adding more weight to the clamp, so that the plastic could stretch until it tears.
3062	2	3	3	a.) Based on the students data, plastic type "B" was the most stretchable of the tested plastic. ^P b.) One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it. Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals.
3063	2	2	2	Based on the student's data it can be concluded that plastic type B has the best elasticity. The student could have improven the experiment by adding trials and specifying in the procedure how much weight is used.
3064	2	2	2	Plastic type B has stretched the most and A the least. D has stayed the same for both trials while C has stretched less n during the second trial and A and B have stretched more. Two ways in which the experiment could be improved is to tell how much weight to add and tell what types of plastics were used in the results.
3065	2	0	0	My conclusion based on the student data is that plastic typ D stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least
3067	2	1	1	I can conclude that plastic C is the weakest out of all the plastics because it stretched the most. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is to do more than two trials in each plastic because two trials is not reliable enough. also, the students should have checked the length of the plastic at different time intervals, like every minute, so you could see how the plastic stretched over time.
3069	2	3	3	A) I conclude that plastic A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^P B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are doing another trial and including the length of the plastic, rerare adding the weights, in the results.
3070	2	2	2	WSR
3071	2	2	2	Type D stretched the same length in test one and two. They could have said what the starting measure of the plastic and how much the wieghts were.
3073	2	2	2	a.Plastic type B had stretched more than plastic type A in trials 1 and 2. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm, and in trial 2 it stretched 1 mm more.^p (b)The student could have put the temperature in the experiment because that could've been a cause of the amount stretched of plastic. the student could've as put the start of how much the plastic weighted in mm.
3074	2	2	2	In this experiment, students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability. In conclusion types A, B stretched at least one or two mm from its original length yet type C shrink and type D remained the same. One way the students could of improved their experiment is by adding how big or heavy the weights they used to stretch experiment is listing where they wanted the top of the plastic taped to the desk.
3075	2	2	2	Based on these results plastic type B and D stretch the most but of the four plastics while plastics A and C sustain their shape much better. The student could have improved the design of this expiriment by setting on exact weight being added to the plastics and by completing one more trial to make a total of three trials.
3076	2	3	3	a. Plastic B was the one with the most stretchability, plastic D came next followed by plastic C then A. ^p b. The student could have included how much the weights weighed. This would make the experiment valid when reproduced. ^p Also, they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched.
3077	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B is more flexible. This is because for each trial, it stretched the most. On the other hand, plastic A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm and 12 mm while B stretched 22mm and 23mm. ^p To improve the validity of the results, the student could have done a third or even fourth trial. This adittional data will make the results clearer. Also, the student should state how much the weights weigh so that others can preform his experiment and get similar results. He might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally.
3079	2	1	1	One conclusion it can draw based on the student's data is that plastic type B is stretched much more (mm) than the other three types maintining the amount of 20 mm in both trials. Based on the data. Plastic type A is less flexible stretch 10mm in the first trial an 12 in the second trial. The student could have stated that they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch.
3080	2	2	2	A conclusion to data is that plastic type B is able to stretch the furthest out of the rest of the plastic types. The student could have improved the design by adding another trial to all plastic types & also by altering the plastic to hang longer.
3081	2	3	3	According to the graph,plastic type B was the plastic that was stretched when plastic that was stretched when plastic type A did not stretch as much. clearly type A is more durable and sturdy .To improve the experimental design the students should have said what each of the starting weights put on the plastic were and do a third trial to make it as accurate as possible.
3082	2	2	2	My conclusion would be that after only two trials plastic type B proved to be the most stretchible of those 4 plastics. One way they could have improved was to do another trial. Another way is instead of only allowing five minutes they should of let hang untill it was about to rip in then measure giving it maximum legnth.
3083	2	2	2	a) A conclusion from this data is that plastic sample B is the the most stretchable.^p b) Two ways that the student could have improved the validity of the results are making the plastic samples the same initial size and allowing the plastic samples to stretch for more than five minutes.
3085	2	2	2	It can be concluded that plastic A is the strongest and most durable plastic it stretched significantly less then most other plastics with an average of 11mm plastic C would be the second best because it stretched an average of 13.5mm.Followed by plastic D with 20mm stretched and lastly plastic B with 2205mm stretched .The student could improve this experiment by adding a control and could be more valid by making sure each plastic was the same length.
3086	2	1	1	The plastic from T2 stretched a little more than it did in T1. They could have made sure the plastic weights the same, and the could of made sure the weights were all equal in each group.
3087	2	3	3	a) In conclusion to the results it can be said that polymer B is the most stretchy, followed by D, then C, then A. The only problems, is that you can't accurately judge it because you can't tell if they are all the same beginning length. A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length. ^p b) One way to improve the design would be to specify the beginning length of the polymer strips. Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer.
3088	2	0	0	It  seems that plastic A is the most strechable because it is the only one that stretched longer. Two ways that the students could improve the experiment is to name the different plastics. Also add heavier weights.
3089	2	3	3	It can be recorded that above all others tested in the experiment, plastic type B is the most stretchable. This is because at 22.5mm it had the largest amount stretched, on average between the two trails or all other plastic types. ^p Two ways this experiment can be improved is to state the amount of weight used foeach trial, with different weights being used, results could have different from what they should have been. Also, because the amount stretched is measured in such small increments (millimeters) more trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy.
3090	2	3	3	A)I conclusion all of the plastic stretched but plastic type B stretched the most in bath trials.^p.B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment design and or validity of the results are.They could have told how much weight to add to the plastics.They could have told the plastic pieces original length.Those are two ways the students could have improved their experiment.
3091	2	0	0	A) Overall in this experiment trial 2 had stretched more than trial 7. ^p B) Try adding more weight to the plastic bags and let the weights hung on the bags for a longer period of time.
3092	2	2	2	(a)The conclusion is that all of the plastics stretched from 10 mm - 23 mm. Plastic type A stretched the least and plastic type B type B stretched the most.^p (b)The students could did a third trial, or make a fourth trial. They could added the temp and weights to the plastic types of the same time and then measured at the same time.
3093	2	3	3	A) The stretchiest of the four materials was B, with the average stretchincs of 22.5mm's. ^P B) The student could have made sure to cut all the plastic into even strips of the same length and width, and second they could have performed another trial for each plastic.
3094	2	2	2	a) You could tell that plastic type B would be the best plastic because it stretched the most with weights onit. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved were said how much the weights weighed. Also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights.
3095	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that the plastics were other a little more or less stretchy the second time due to it being stretched out the first time. One way the student could have improved the experiment design was by performing a third trial without weights. Another way would be to allow them to hand for about 10 minutes the 3rd time.
3096	2	0	0	They can conclude that even after a second trial of stretching, the plastics significantly didn't stretch to much larger than trial 1.
3097	2	2	2	3. In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most because during 11 it stretched 22mm and during 12 it stretched the least. ^p The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more ways to stretch the plastic. For example, adding little heat. The results could have simply been improved with a few more trials.
3098	2	2	2	Based on the students data it can conclude that plastic type D is the plastic with the most stretchability. Two ways, this experiment could have been improved is by adding more trials, also adding the amount of weights and being specific about the length of each plastic.
3099	2	2	2	3. A) Plastic type B had stretched the most out of both of the trials. ^p B) added more trials more time for plastic to be hanging.
3101	2	3	3	a) A conclusion that can be made from this data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because in both trials it stretched 22-23 mm and that is more than any other plastic type tested. ^p b)Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant. Also for the plastic samples the student could make sure to have the starting length afall the plastic types be the same and constant. Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
3103	2	0	0	I think e 11/12 40/40.
3104	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the data given is that each piece of plastic stretched around the same amount each trial. This lets you know that it his as really the only amount it can given one it wasn't really change her multiple trays. Two ways the student could have improved the validity is by making each amount of plastic the same and by using the same amount or weight for each trial.
3105	2	1	1	In conclusion, if the student was to go on with the investigation, T2 will allways have depending on the plastic 12, 23, 13, 20 up the numbers. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimtal are, 1) The could of told us how much weights to and 2) If they hang the clamp for 10min the experiment might have change.
3106	2	3	3	a) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials. I also noticed that the most stretchable was B and the least was A.^P b)Though two trials is good, it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best. Also I think that they should have measured the length of the plastic before and have it on the the data table to compare the changes the occured in the plastics.
3107	2	2	2	Based on the student's data C is wrong because the first time is streched 14mm then the second time is stretched 13 how is that possible the second trial should be more or equal if the used the same weight.^p b) He could told us how much weight he used. Also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right.
3108	2	1	1	Based on the students data I can say that plastic type C can stretch the most because in both trials plastic type C stretched atleast 9mm longer than the second hoghest plastic stretchability. To improve the experimental design the students could have said how much weight should be attached to the clamp and exactly what steps should be repeated in the second trial.
3109	2	0	0	Based on this students information i would say that the first 2 exceeded, because they went up the second time. This means it went farther. But, for the last too, the went down or stayed the same. A way the student could have improved was to make step 6 in the procedure more clear, by saying what steps to repeat. Second way they could improved was by for step five put more steps because step 5 has like 3 steps in one.
3111	2	1	1	According to the data table the conclusion of this experiment would be that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials 1 and trials 2. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to try different amounts of weights that get attached to each plastic and also to let the plastic hang for different amounts of time to see the affect it would have.
3112	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A has the most stretchability than the other plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results if they had more trials and a better control.
3114	2	2	2	a) I conclude, that Plastic type A stretched the most(2ml). ^p b)To improve the experimental design and/or mostly of the results, species the amount of weight added to the clamp, and make all pieces of places for one uniform length.
3115	2	3	3	I have come to the conclusion that plastic type B has the best stretching ability since the data shows it stretched 22 mm and 23 mm. The students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same. Also, the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials.
3116	2	3	3	In conclusion, it can be said that plastic. Type B had the most amount stretched because its numbers in T1 (22)and T2 (23) were the highest. Also the plastic type that was more durable and was not stretched is muuh was plastic type A because its number in T1(10) was and T2 (12) were the lowest to improve this experiment,it would be better to include three trials and include the plastics type initial measurements to make the data table more specific and efficient.
3117	2	2	2	Based on the data table, plastic type B stretched the most in the 15 minutes with the amount stretched for T 1 was 22mm and for T2 -23mm. So type B had the most stretchability .^p 2 ways the students could have improved their experiment would be labeling the type of plastic they were using instead of putting plastic type A, B, C, and D. And another way they could've improved their experiment would be tpoput how many weights they clamped to the plastic for each plastic. So we can see how far the plastics stretched, and how many weights were used.
3118	2	1	1	One way the students can improve there experiment is to do a other trial to see if they misssted anything.
3119	2	3	3	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the weakest plastic out of them all, and the strogest polymer plastic is plastic A because it was stretched the least. ^p B) The students could've included more discription on the plastic, like each plastics length or width, in order to show that everything was the same in length and width. Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used.
3120	2	2	2	A) Pased on the results plastic B is the most stretchy and A is the least. The order is from most shotely to  least B D C A. ^p b) The student could of improved experimental design by being more specific. He could change "Bottom edge" in step 3 to "Edge of the side of the table." Additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights.
3121	2	2	2	My conclusion from the data presented is plastic type B and C through B and C increased higher but D stays constant at 20, those were only with two trials the student should have done more trials and should have stated the length of the paper.
3122	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type A is the strongest. This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average. Two ways that the students could have improved their lab is by saying how long the types of plastic should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and how many weights should be added to the clamp because there could have been an error when the plastics were different lengths with different amounts of weights and this would make the data inaccurate.
3123	2	2	2	I conclude that plastic B stretched the most but plastic D was constant. He could have added more that's. He should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate.
3124	2	3	3	a) The stretchiest kind of plastic was type B. because it stretched the most.^p ^p b) The student could have given the weights and the original length of the plastic in the procedure and made sure they were constant.
3126	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the most in both trials one and two. Plastic type A stretched the least in both of the trials.^p The students could have improved the experiment design by conduction more trials and so stating how many weights they added on top of the clamps. The results werent valid.
3127	2	2	2	a) Based on the data, the most stretchable plastic was plastic B b/c it stretched 22 mm on the first trial and 23 mm on the second trail. Also, the least stretchable plastic was plastic A b/c it only stretched in during T1 _ 12 during T2. Plastic C stretched only a bit more than plastic A. Plastic D stretched 20 mm's both times making it the 2nd most stretchable out of the 4.
3128	2	2	2	A. My hypothesis was correct plastic type 'A' stretched the least during the experiment. I noticed that the plastic that stretched the least was most commonly used in our town to hold the heaviest items. ^P B. To improve the validabil of the experiment the students should have used a specific amount of each plastic not just a 'sample'. Also the students should have stretched the plastic across a gap and placed weights on top. This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use.
3129	2	1	1	Based on the students data it is concluded that their  wasn't much stretchability from the plastic samples. Sample A increased 2mm from T1 to T2. Sample B increased 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample C decreased by 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample D stayed the same in T1 and T2. This experiment could be improved if the student had a control which would be the measure of each plastic sample without any weight added.They could also repeat the experiment.
3130	2	2	2	a. Plastic B was the most stretchy. It was 22mm in the first trial in the second trial it stretched 1 more millimeter. The second most strechy polimer was plastic D I remained at 20mm both trials. ^p b. The students could have improved the experimental design! validity of the results bys I. Specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2. They could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights.
3131	2	1	1	Out of all the polmer plastics type A stretched a total of 2 mm as the best one. ^p To have a control and to make sure to tell us how long the plastic is.
3132	2	3	3	a) In this experiment,it  can be concluded that plastic B had the most stretchability with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. Also I can conclude that plastic A of the polymer plastics stretched the least with an average of 11m overall. Then plastic C stretched an average of 12mm and plastic D stretched 20mm^p b)Two ways to improve this experiment would have been to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length as the add to the end of the plastic they could also add a 3rd trial to make the experiment more valid.
3133	2	1	1	(a) In this data it shows how far different type of plastic can be stretched. Plastic type A was stretched 2mm within trial 1 and 2. Plastic type B was stretched 1mm. Lastly plastic type D was stretched 0mm. In conclusion plastic type A was the easiest to stretch. ^p (B) Two ways it could have been improved was a have more tests and what what type of plastic.
3134	2	3	3	Through this data recorded from the experiment, we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup. This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials. One way  this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents . For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same. Also, to improve validity, the student should have had the same starting length of plastics. thing this
3135	2	0	0	a) Plastic type A was strethier because on the first trial it streched out to 10mm and in the second trial it streched out to 12mm. It had streched longer, but plastic type D seems to have been stronger, it only streched 20mm through out both of the trials.
3136	2	1	1	A: I think that plastic D in both trials had the most weights out of the three other plastics from the student's data. ^P B: Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is one that the student could have done five trials instead of two to see the difference. Also instead of four plastics but five he or she could improve the statement too.
3137	2	2	2	In conclusion in trial one plastic type B streched the most while plastic type A was the lowest in trial two plastic type B streched the furtherist. ^P Measure the height of the table, weigh the weights.
3138	2	1	1	(A) Plastic type B was able to hold the most weights for each trial. ^p (B) Two ways they could have improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials for each plastic or they  could have let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes.
3140	2	2	2	Based on this student's data, the type with the most amount of stretching was plastic type b with 20mm and plastic A had the least with 10 the first trial and 12 the second. The student could've conducted more trials as well as stated what the types of plastic were.
3141	2	3	3	The plastic with the least stretch would be plastic A because it had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the table.
3142	2	3	3	a. I concluded that plastic type B had the best stretchability and plastic type A had the least.^P b. The student should have included in the procedure how many weight to put on the clamp and describe where on the bottom edge of the plastic to put the clamp.
3143	2	0	0	In conclusion the students data show that when the plastic was stretch each material stretched only 1-2 mm. This is not a very big change in length. The data also showed that for one of the plastics after stretched lost a mm of length. So this was not a very succsecfull lab. ^P One thing that they could do to improve this is to tell us what kind of plastic to use so the experiment is easier to test and also to have a control variable to really see the change in plastics.
3144	2	1	1	My conclusion is that type B is the most stretchy, based on the results. The student should have improved this by doing it in even trials even though. Other could be how, put there's experiment on the table. This would have improved the validity.
3145	2	1	1	a. Type D plastic stretched the same amount in trial 1 and 2. It stretched 20mm. ^p b. In the procedure the students can get rid of step 7 because step 6 basically states the same thing. Also, they could have done three trials for more data.
3147	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B is the most polymer for stretchability because in both trials it erected the most making it the most stretched out of the all other polymers.^p Two ways the student could have improved is by saying which plastics the students used for each so the people would know if the data is correct and by saying how much weight was used to stretch the plastic.
3148	2	3	3	A) In conclusion plastic type
3149	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. ^P b) -1) The students could have specified how heavy the weights were. ^P 2) They could've let the plastic hang for more than 5 minutes.
3152	2	1	1	(A) In conclusion, plastic B and D have more stretchability than A and C because plastics B and D stretched an average of 21mm while plastics A and C stretched an average of 12mm. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to do more trials and to add a control.
3153	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, it is easy to conclude that plastic type D was the most constant through both trials with a measurement of 20 mm. The student's, though could have improved their experiment by doing more trials and by also being more specific. For example, saying what types of plastic they used instead of saying A, B, C or D. Also they could have said how much weight was added so that it is clear and exact.
3154	2	1	1	A. In conclusion, based on the student's data polymer plastic B stretch the most in both trials done & the least that stretch both trials was type A, leaving us to see B is the most stretchable from all for types. ^p B She could have included a time limit for the plastic to dangle freely. Second she could have made a graph to have it be more visual.
3155	2	3	3	Based on the data, we can tell that plastic type A stretches the least amount of all other types of plastic. It only stretched an average of 11 mm which was less than all others. The students could improve their experiment by adding another trial. This always verifies the validity of an experiment. They could also verify how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experiment.
3156	2	1	1	A conclusion draw is that trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more. Plastic type D was the same in trail 1 and 2. The students could have improved the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see what you get. Also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials.
3160	2	3	3	a) Based on the data, they can conclude that plastic B stretched the most.^p b) They could have included the mass of the weights added. They also should have included the size of the plastic samples.
3161	2	0	0	My conclusion is trials (T2) stretched better than (T2). The student could have used a different type of plastic and they could have just made the sample very larger.
3162	2	3	3	a. Based on the student data, plastic type B stretched the most. Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm. ^p b. The student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add.
3163	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B stretched the most probably hefty or ziplock) ^p B) Taken thickness temp in room, original length, etc.
3164	2	3	3	The plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. Two ways the student could have improved his experiment was, 1) to include in his data table how much weight he used on the clamp. 2) To include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table.
3165	2	3	3	The students wanted to determine in this experiment which type of plastic A, B C, or D was able to stretch the most. Based on the data, plastic B had the best stretchability and was able to stretch 22 mm in the first trial and 23 mm in the second trial. The students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results. To improve their experimental design they could have been more specific and stated how many weights should be added to the plastics and to better control the experiment.
3166	2	1	1	Based on the data table I would say that plastic D was your strongest plastic, because it didn't stretch. One way they could of improved the experiment was to run a trial 3 to tell plastic D. Another way they could of improved the experiment is by adding many weights.
3167	2	2	2	Based on the students data, the plastic B is the most strechable polymer plastic. Plastic A is the least strechable. This is because plastic B was streched at 22mm (1st trial) and 23mm (2nd trial). Comparing it to the others, it streched the furthest. Plastic A only stretched 10mm (1st trial) and 12mm (2nd trial). To improve this experiment, the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic. They also should have done one more trial to ensure validity. Three trials can help make this definite.
3168	2	2	2	In conclusion the plastics stretched more during the second trial than the first.The second trial the first. The second trial all plastics stretched further except for type C and D which did not change. Two ways to make this better would have been to do a third trial and to specify how much the weights were.
3170	2	1	1	In conclusion all the plastic types are all different amount stretched. The plastic stretching out in trials 1-2 are going up and down. ^p The student could have improved by doing a third trial to show more of the results. Explain why they added more weight.
3171	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched the least amount. ^p b) For the student to improve the experimental design they could have written how much weight the put on the plastics. and to improve, the validity they should have done a third trial.
3172	2	0	0	A.In the polymer investigation there werent a lot of change plastic type a stretched only 2 mm, type B stretched 1 mm, type c stretched 1mm and D stayed the same.^p B.Could of been more accurate with the steps on the procedure.
3175	2	0	0	In conclusion, based on the students data there are four different type of plastic. Based of the plastic are T1,T2 their amount stretched (mm). And based in the Dutch table T2 is more stretched than T1. The students can describe experimental based in diffent plastic . And the students can based in that data table the T2 is more stretched.
3176	2	3	3	a) After investigating how much each plastic type stretched, a conclusion has made that plastic type B stretched most than D, Than C and plastic type A stretched the least. b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was to first use the same starting length of the plastic bag that could effect the results and secondly be more specific about how much weight to add.
3177	2	3	3	Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. Type A stretched an average of 11mm, type C stretched an average 13.5mm and type D stretched 20mm. But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. ^P B) The student could have improved his experiment by telling how long the plastic was as well as how the weights weighed. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial.
3178	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is, plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability in (mm). In both trials the plastic stretched further than the other type. In trial 1 22mm, and trial 2 23mm. 3. The student could have made this lab more valid by adding the different types of plastics that were labeled A, B, C, and D and also the student could have set an exact length for each plastic so they all started at the same measurement.
3179	2	2	2	A. The students could have concluded that plastic type B has the largest amount of stretchability, because type B stretched 22 min in trial one and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p B. The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by; 1. Doing more trials to collect more data. 2. Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min.
3180	2	2	2	A) A conclusion that can be brought from the data is that plastic type B is the best type of plastic fore  stretchability because it stretched 22mm and 23mm on it's trials. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by having or stating that the plastics all had the same initial measurement. Also, the student could have named the type of plastics. The validity can be questioned because it is unknown if they were the same length to begin with and the plastic is unknown.
3181	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic B stretches more than the other plastics. The students could improve this experiment by checking the temperature of the room because plastic's elasticity varies on the temperature. Another improvement would be to measure the amount of weight that is being put into each bag.
3182	2	2	2	The data showas the plastic for stretching more in B. Because maybe the put or did different procesure. But experiment D have the same type of stretching. The procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times. The students have to do the procesure, they have to do the experiment like three time as or more. The need to have all the materials and put it in order. The need to have his own question. Find his conclusion.
3183	2	1	1	My conclusion is that plastic type D stretched the farthest both trials. They could have done another trial and they could have put more weights on the clamp so it can stretch more.
3184	2	1	1	Plastic type A held up best against the wheight of the wheights. So I would use the plastic out of any where. Plastic type D expanded and stretched the most. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was, one; name the plastics and two; tell how much the wheights wheighed.
3185	2	3	3	a) A conclusion I can draw with the data present is that some plastics are more stretchy than others. For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A. ^p b) To improve there experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial. Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched.
3186	2	0	0	One way it would have been good to improve the experiment is listing the steps or procedure properly.
3187	2	3	3	A) My conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B has the highest stretchability. I say this because plastic B had stretched more in 5 minitues than any of the other plastics in this expirement. ^p B) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs. One way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights. They could have also add more trials to improve their design.
3188	2	1	1	A)Based on the data that the st recordity I think plastic B will work better with 23mm. When the stud 22mm and plastic T2 with 23mm, when the student have to add weight to clam and allow for 5 minutes.^p (B)Anex could add more trial and try other type of plastic.
3189	2	1	1	From the students data looks like the first trials were good but the second trials the plastic stretches more. It looks like the second trial for A, B, C, O hanged there for a by with the weights the last trial. The student could have improved the experimental design if it would of have more plastics and add ,ore minutes to see what would happen if it stayed longer then 5 minutes. Another way could have been if you knew how many weights you were putting on the clamp. So youwill know how many weights and how long would make this experiment improve.
3190	2	3	3	3. a) Plastic A is the most resistant and the strongest because it stretched the least out of the 4 plastics. This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains. ^p b) The experiment could be improved by using the same amount of the weights on each type of plastic. This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately. Also, the trial should be performed more than 2 times. Since results varied greatly by up to 2mm with the 2nd trial, this variation would be minimized with more trials.
3191	2	3	3	base on the data table plastic type B stretched the most amount in 22 mm in trial 1 and 23 mm in trial  before apping. The two ways the students could have improved their experiment better is by lableing how much weight was the weight add they to the clamp and also by adding more trials to see more accracy.
3192	2	1	1	In the procedure it doesn't have a clear problem of what is happening on the experiment. On procedure 7, it doesn't tell you the trial that thy did for the first one. Two ways the students can aprove is on the last trial explains whats the first trial is and not make the person reading it not to know whats the trial is. The last way is for number four it says add weights to the clamp and alowthem to hange for 5 minutes. How heavy are the weights you need to use on the experiment.
3194	2	0	0	3/4 increased by 1, 1/4 decreased by 1 and 1/4 stayed the. ^p b.) Two ways of improving; ^p 1)Used a different weight for second trial. ^p 2) Or used four different types of plastic.
3196	2	3	3	NSR
3197	2	3	3	A. In conclusion we found that plastic type B had the most stretchability, it stretched out the most both trials and that plastic type A was less stretchable. ^p B. Two ways the students can improve there experiment design is to do three more so the experiment can be more valid and 2 they should identify how much weight they put on the clamp.
3198	2	0	0	One way the coud of used rocks instead of weights to improve the experiment design. ^P Second way instead of measure the length after the weight they should measure the length of the plasic while the weight was ve there.
3199	2	1	1	A conclusion I can make based on the student's data is that plastic A can only stretch about 11 mm. Plastic B can strech about 22.5mm. Plastic C can strech about 13.5 mm and plastic D can only strech 20 mm. One way the experiment could have been improved is by skeeping the weight added through out the experiments the same. The second way to improve the experiment is for the plastic to be maesured in asmaller unit rather than mm.
3200	2	1	1	a) My conclusion is that plastic type D was the strongest of them all.^p B) Two way he can improve the experiment is be using the same amount of time, and the same amount of plastics.
3201	2	2	2	a) The conclusion I can get from the data is plastic A went from 10mm to 12mm, plastic B went from 22mm to 23mm, plastic C went down from 1mm to 13mm, and plastic D stayed at 20mm. ^p B) The way they could improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial, and showed how much weight they used.
3202	2	3	3	a.) A conclusion I can draw from the experiment is that that plastic type B has the most stretchability because it stretched the greatest amount of mm which wass 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. ^p b.) The student could improve this experiment by specifying a certain length all polymer plastics should start out as so they all begin on the same level and therefore the data is accurate. Also, the student could specify how many milimeters of each plastic should be taped to the table so they all start put the same length & make the data more accurate.
3203	2	3	3	A) plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least. ^p B) They could add more trials and be more specific when the say "weights" by adding how heavy the weights are.
3204	2	0	0	It will be not that different from the other test that was done because if there went down or up a little. He could have done a bar graph for the things he was trying to figure out about it all or just had at least told the time he did it.
3205	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials. Another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type.
3208	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least. This shows that plastic type B have less cross linking of its polymers while plastic A had the greatest amount of cross linking. ^p b) One way the students could have improved their experiment could be, add another trial to get a bigger range to make sure the data is accurate, another way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more plastic types for a longer sample size.
3209	2	1	1	3.a. The students experiment was a good experiment because ( they had 4 different plastic types they had two trials to check and recheds for experiment. ^p b. They could have had more trials, they should had more plastic types.
3210	2	0	0	A) Based on the data as you see, different type of plastic they would be different or the same on both trials. For example plastic type A first. Trial is werent stretchable and when you repeat it again it would change. ^p B) Two ways to make it better was have more different plastics and maybe add more weight to the clamp to see what changes.
3211	2	2	2	a) My conclusion according to the data would be that plastic B stretched the most. ^p B) Some ways the students could improve their experiment is if they said how much weights was on the plastics. Also they should of not have done the second trial exactly the same as the first cause there would be no difference so the data should be the same as the first because the second trial was supposed to be done exactly the same as the first.
3212	2	3	3	a: Plastic type b has the most amount of stretchability in all the four plastics. ^P b: The students could have repeated the experiment a third time and made sure that they were adding the same size weights everytime.
3213	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length. Plastic type A was the most resistant to stretch. b. The students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results. In step 1 of the procedure, it says "take a sample of one type of plastic B measasure its length". This is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment. This is important b/c the longest should be the piece is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch. Finally students need to change step 9 "add some weights" to a specific number of weight. This is important b/c if they put more weight on one plastic it will stretch farther, than a plastic w/ less weight attached.
3214	2	0	0	I guess when the plastic reaches a certain amount it will break. ^p They should of used a different type of plastic to see how it works out.
3215	2	2	2	In conclusion. Plastic A was the least streched after two tries also plastic B was the most stretchest after the two tries. The student could have improved the experimental design by being more specific and also measured the length of the materials before doing the experiment.
3216	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B is the strongest. For example, in trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design are adding another trial and increase the amount of time it hangs.
3217	2	1	1	A)Plastic type B is more flevable and stronger, some plasticstretch more after the first trial like 10mm-12mm^p B) I think having more trials so his data can be more percise and having A catrol
3218	2	2	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways they could improve the experiment is by adding more trials and check to make sure all other variables are constant such as temperature.
3219	2	1	1	Plastic type B stretched more than all other plastic types.^p One way  the experiment could have been improved is if they kept on adding weights until the plastic broke and measured how much weight it can hold. Another way is of puting one plastic on top of another and add the weight and see if that changes how far one on the plastic stretches.
3220	2	0	0	The students conclusion was not much because there was many types of plastics to choose from. ^p The students could have improved the experiment if the student picked a certain type of plastic not any type. Other reason is that they not the weights in the same spot in trial 1 and trial 2.
3221	2	2	2	a) In conclusion of this experiment, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most in both trials of the experiment. Also it seems as if plastic type A was the stacking in the experiment as it only stretched a half the amount of plastic type A. ^p b) Instead of "add weights" they could have given a specific amount of time. They also could have given the original lengths of each plastic.
3222	2	2	2	a) Based on our results, we can conclude that plastic B was the weakest because it stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p b) They could have mentioned more contents such as the weight they put on the bag sample every trial. ^p They should have had a control, atrial where no weights were added.
3223	2	2	2	A conclusion of the experiment would be that plastic B was the stretchiest plastic. Also, that plastic A was the least stretchy. Make all the plastic samples the same length and make sure that T1 and T2 have the same amount of plastic.
3224	2	1	1	3.a) The plastics A +b stretched farther the 2nd time but d+c stayed the same or went down. ^p B) Stretched it a third time or measure it when it was hanging off the table.
3225	2	2	2	A)Based on the student's data, the plastic that has has the most stretchability is plastic type A. It started at 10 mm and then the weight added on it stretched to 12mm. Plastic type D has no stretchability, It remained at 20 mm for the second trial.^p (b) One way the student could have improved the results and validity of them is by stating how much weight was added to each type of plastic bag. Also if you record the length A was before adding weights, you can see how for each bag stretched from itself. Right now there is no constant in the experiment.
3226	2	3	3	Based on the students data, it can be seen that plastic B stretched 22mm (T1) and 23mm (T2) making it the most stretchable. ^p The students could have improved the experiment by including the length of the plastics before stretching them. Also, they need to include how much weight to add to the plastic, making it the same for each plastic to be valid.
3227	2	2	2	The conclusion of this experiment would be that type B was the most amount stretched, it stretched 22 then try 2 was 23 meanwhile type A stretched the least. In try one A stretched 10 & 2nd try stretched 12. The two ways students can improvr the experimenta; design, is to always give it a 3rd try. What is your control.
3228	2	1	1	From reading this students procedure and reviewing their data, I have realized some plastics are significantly better than others. The data shows that plastic type B that stretched 22mm and 23mm, and plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. Types B and C because that table shows A that stretched 10 and 12mm are type C stretched 14 and 13 mm. In conclusion, plastic type B and D are much stronger than A and C. b) Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is allowing them to hang for more than 5 minutes to get better data. Also, running a third trial will improve their results.
3229	2	1	1	In the second trial, plastic A the stretch increased by two bara, Plastic B the second trial increased by one mm: almost it decreased one mm now in plastic D the stretch stayed the same. Two ways student could have improved their lab or validity, one was to have a third trial so you could see if there would have been a great change or to see which results were closer to results one and two to make your final choice. Another way to improve the lab was to try different measurements of plastic.
3230	2	2	2	According to the experiment, the type of plastic that had the greatest ability to stretch was plastic B. In both trials, this plastic stretched a few mm more than the rest. In the first trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 22mm. ^P The student could have improved the experiment by using a certain amount of weights added so that all the plastics would be under the same pressure and to add a control such as no weights. The control would have made a good bomparison to the data gathered and the amount of weights would have made created controlled variables.
3231	2	2	2	Plastic type B has the best stretchability out of all the other plastics. two ways that the students could improve on there experimental design and valitedy is by having a control and by telling the reader the amount of weights to the plastic so that they can replicate the procedure.
3232	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest. And plastic type A was the least streechyest at of all the other plastics one way the student could have improved his results was if he/she added the same amount of weights everytime .Also If they did more trials they would probly get more validity results.
3233	2	0	0	In conclusion,you can conclude that plastic B measured the longest which was 12 (T1) and 23 (T2), also you can see that plastic type D had came the closes to plastic B, plastic D measured 20mm for both trials^p b) They could improve their experiment if the actually added more minutes each trial to see different outcome and compare. Also, could've added more weights.
3234	2	2	2	Based on this student's results I can conclude that the most stretchable plastic is type B. Type B plastic stretched 22 mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. Some thing that could have been done to improve the validity of the experiment would be to do a third trial. In an experiment can make the results more accurate depending on the amount of trials there are in your experiment.
3235	2	1	1	The data shows that the plastic types stretched about the same in both trials. In the procedures the student must say which she is recording the data. I think the data would have a better conclusion if the student did another trial for each different plastic.
3236	2	2	2	A) The order from the most stretchable to the lest strechable is plastic types B first, D second, C third, and A last. Plastic type B streched the furthest at 22mm 1st trail and 23mm the second trial. A was the least strechability and streched 10mm 1st trail and 12mm the second. ^P B) The student could have done more trails or they could have let it hand longer.
3237	2	1	1	(A) In conclusion, based on the students data, the plastic samples stretched slightly more in the second trial. Plastic type D was the only plastic that kept its length constant. (B) To improve the validity of the results I would've measured the plastic's width. To improve the design, I would've used a fifth plastic type to expand my results.
3241	2	1	1	In conclusion, the strongest plastic that held up is plastic type B. In trail one was statend 22mm and trail; two was 23mm, while plastic type A got 10mm for the first trail and 12mm for the second trail. So over all the plastics, type B  is the one that can hold up the longest and is more durable. One way this lab could do is to add more trails. Then another improvement could be to explain exly in the produre to get three more bags.
3243	2	3	3	a) From the data, I've seen, I can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most even though between both trials it only increased 1 mm, 22-23. But on the otherhand plastic type D only hit 20 and stayed 20, still being close to B. ^P b) I know two way that I could improve the experiment; first the student should say how long each plastic should be; second, the student should say how much weight is being put on each time.
3244	2	3	3	According to their, the students results, plastic sample A is the least stretchy while sample B was the most stretchy. I do not, however, believe these results are valid. They should have used exact measurement when saying to "add weight" to the clamp. Another thing they could have done was added a third trial for increased accuracy, and to that same note come up with an average stretch distance for each sample, making it even more accurate.
3245	2	1	1	So they should of told us if we have to wait five wen for all three bottles or do we time it different one another. Also do we use the same length for all three plastic bag or are we spouse to use a different length for all three plastic bag.
3246	2	2	2	A) The student are trying to figure out which plastic can stretch more than the other without braking adding weights. ^p (B) The students could improve the experiment if they were to add a specific number of weights to each plastic. Also having the same measurement size for each plastic.
3248	2	1	1	As we can come to a close the students in results were very close numbers when they did trial 1 and then trial 2, we can see that when they stretched both trials they got the same answers 20mm. This is what we can conclude about the data.
3249	2	1	1	From the data, it's drawn that type B has the most stretchability than the others. In trial one, it held the highest weight count for 20 weights. In the second trial it had a total of 23. For the experiment to give a more accurate result, the weights should have been added on past the limit for each plastic. That way data could show how many weights each held until breaking, strengthening the results for or against the hypothesis.
3250	2	0	0	A) Both plastics no matter how far its stretch, weather its in trial one or trial two, is that their both about the same (mm) maybe off by one/two. ^P B) Two switch up the difference from trial 2 to trial 1. Also to use different plastics to see different results.
3251	2	2	2	a. From the data table it can be said that plastic A is the most stretchy and that the other plastics have little to no stretchability. ^P b. ^P 1. The length of the plastics need to be kept constant. ^P More trials need to be done, at the minimal, three.
3252	2	3	3	(A) After finding all of the measurements and recording the data, I can see that plastic type B has the most stretchability. Then  plastic type S, then C and finally A, which has the least amount of stretchability.
3253	2	3	3	The student can conclude that type B was the most stretchable while type A was the least. The student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched. The student should also have the exact amount of weighs that was to be applied.
3254	2	1	1	A) The student tested the plastic 4 different types they altumetly had the same close 1 to 2 mm streach rate.^p B) The student could have stated how much each whight should whigh he could have also changed the results then messure or record the difference.
3255	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A was able to overall stretch the most compared to other three plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the validity of the results by having more trials and by having a control group.
3256	2	0	0	The plastic streched more and more each time. ^p I think that the student could have been more specific when writing out the steps because it would have been easier to understand the data.
3257	2	1	1	a. Based on the student's data I conclude that plastic type D has the most stretchability than all the other plastic types. In both trials they stretched to 20mm while the other plastic types didnt that far. ^p Two ways the student would have improved the experimental design/ validity is 1) did one more trial to make sure its possible stretchability. 2) used same materials.
3258	2	2	2	A. The students concluded plastic B can stretch the farthest, but plastic A is the most durable.^p B) The students could had a control & the students could have made the samples the same size.
3259	2	0	0	One way the student could improve the experiment better is by putting the plastic in both directions at the same time. Another way he could improve is he could add heavier weights to get better data. ^p In conclusion when he added the weights to one end that made the plastic stretch and, increasing its size.
3260	2	0	0	The conclusion
3261	2	1	1	Based on the student's data, the conclusion can be made because their is nothing to the test the results to. This experiment can be improved by measuring the initial length at the polymer to show the difference in length that the weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control to test against their variables to add to the validity.
3262	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchial polymer or plastic low of the ones tested it can stretch the most. Plastic A stretched the least. ^P b) 1) The student needs to specify how many weights should be added & how much those weights shall weigh. ^P 2) The student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every plastic type they should be placed at the same points on the table.
3263	2	2	2	Based on the students data you can't really come to a conclusion because there isn't enough data. Two ways the student could improve the experiment are by adding more trials to the data is better and by stating that all of the plastics were cut to the same length you would want to do that because if the plastics aren't all the same lengths that could affect the data.
3264	2	1	1	a) Plastic B stretched the most amount  therefore it is the most stretchabil. b) The students could have measured the length after 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes. They could have added more weights.
3265	2	3	3	Plastic B had the greatest stretchability the students should have included how much the weights they used weighed and how many weights they used. Also they should have included another trial.
3266	2	3	3	a) Plastic B stretches the most. ^p b) The student should have kept the length and width of the plastic samples constant and specified how much weight to attatch.
3267	2	3	3	a.) Plastic type B has the highest stretchabilty.^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their results. They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant. Also, they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy.
3268	2	0	0	For plastic tube A and b the amount stretched went up a point. For plastic tube c it went down a pont and for D the plastic stretched stayed the same. ^P They could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min.
3269	2	2	2	My conclusion based on this data is that plastic type "B" stretched the most in both the first and second trial. One way this student could have made their experiment better would be by re arranging their procedure and doing # 7 before #6. Another way they could have improved would be by allowing the reader to know how heavy the weights were that were used in this experiment.
3270	2	2	2	a). Plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b). The validity of the experiment would be improved if a control were added. The control in this experiment would be a plastic hanging off the table with no weight for five minutes. Also, the experiment does not specify whether to use the same amount of weight for all plastics or the specific amount thats suppose to be used. To improve the experiment the specific amount of weight should be mentioned and should be held constant for all plastics.
3271	2	0	0	Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results was probelly trying the experiment with a bigger cup not a small cup. Second would be then potting more weight to the cup and then maybe their would be a difference on the experiment.
3272	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched more than any of the other types of plastic in both of its trials. ^p b) One way the student could have improved their experimental results would be to have a third trial of all the practice to enhance precision and accuracy of results. Another way to improve thes results would be to average the figures from the trials.
3274	2	1	1	Based on the data each plastic improved on T2. Two ways they could have improved the experiment was by making sure they used the sam weight for each trial and also use a stop watch to get exact time.
3275	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B has the most stretchability. Also plastic type A has the least stretchability. The student could have had another trial.
3276	2	3	3	Based on the student's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the farthest amount. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials. Another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same.
3278	2	2	2	In conclusion, out of the 4 tested polymer plastics, plastic type B proved to have the best stretchability because it stretched 22 mm during T1 and 23 mm during T2. One way the students could've improved their experiment is to preform a 3rd trial so results can be proved to be more reliable. A second way they can improve is to run a trial where the plastics hold weights for maybe 10 minutes so they could conclude if maybe some plastics would break in the process of being stretched.
3279	2	2	2	One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add how much weight they were putting on the plastics. Another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial.
3280	2	3	3	Based on the data, I would conclude that plastic type B stretched the most, as it had an average of 22.5 mm stretched. One way the student could have improved his experiment design would have been to add another trial so that the results would have been more valid the to more results to a range. Another way the student could have improved his experiment would have been to give a specific mass for the weights attached to the plastic so that other people can do the experiment and get the same results.
3281	2	0	0	The conclusion that can be drawn from the label is that the second trial was more succesful at being stretched out. Two ways that the students could of improved the design of the results are increasing the amount of time the plastic was stretched. Also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the clamp to. To me it would be also helpful if a control was run to compare results.
3282	2	3	3	(a) From the given results, one can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest type out of the four that were tested. ^p (b) However, there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved. One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic. If the sizes vary, the data found is useless. Uncomparable. Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials. You can not obtain consistancy, a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment, in only two trials.
3283	2	2	2	a)In conclusion the plastic type D stretched the most compared to any other plastic.^p b) One way the experiment could be improved would be to keep the length of the given plastic equal. Another improvement would live to add the same amount if weight to each plastic and lot the weight the procedure.
3284	2	0	0	a. In conclusion, after five minutes the plastic types were stretched longer for plastics A and B. Plastic c decreased in trial 2, and plastic d stayed the same.^p b. Two ways, the student could have improved the experiment are: 1. Added or decreased the weights amount in trial 2.2. let the weights hang for longer/shorter amount of time.
3286	2	1	1	a) I can conclude from the results plastic type A stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. ^p b) They could of added more details to the procedure. For example to record all our data.
3287	2	1	1	A) The plastic type B was the stretchiest and A was the least stretchy. ^p B) One way this experiment design could be improved is have multiple times recording the stretch length like 5, 10, 15 minutes. The other way is adding more weights.
3288	2	2	2	I concluded that plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^P One way they could improved this experiment was by completing three or more trials. ^P A second way they could improve this experiment is to limit the weights they put on the plastics then have it go up as a whole.
3289	2	2	2	In the experiment, plastic type B stretched the most with 222-23mm in length, type A stretched least with 10-12mm in stretching. C stretched the second least (14-13mm) and D closely followed B (20mm in stretching). It is very clear that plastic type B has the most stretchability and type A has the least. To improve this experiment one could designate how much weight should be applied to the clamp for each repeating of procedure on each of the four plastics. Also, a control group could be added.
3290	2	2	2	A conclusion I can draw from this experiment is that the second trial (T2) had increased the amount of plastic stretched, all expert plastic type C which remioved the same two ways the students could have improved the experimental designs was by measuring the weights for each clamp and another way was to have a third trial.
3291	2	1	1	A conclusion could be that different plastics have different amounts that it could be stretched at. The student could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an varity of cups.
3292	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment. ^p b) First, the student should have used the same length of each plastic. Finally, the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table.
3293	2	3	3	The conclusion drawn from the data would be that plastic type B stretches the most, because it was the longest length after being stretched. The student could improve the experiment by adding more trials, to get more data to drawn make accurate conclusion from. The student could also cut the plastic to the same starting length in order to ensure that they all have the same start, and the results would be more accurate.
3294	2	1	1	A) The whole procedure worked out well. I think the results came out to be almost the same when they repeated it.^p B) I think the student should have 'did' a third trial. Also I think he should have chase two different plastics to see how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table
3295	2	3	3	In conclusion to the polymer investigation lab, it is clearly known that plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least, according to the data collected. To improve the experiment the lab testers should have made sure that the plastic were all at the same length at the stare and recorded it. Also, they should've made sure they used the same weights.
3296	2	2	2	In conclusion, The polymer plastic that was the most stretchable, according to our experiments data, was plastic type A (10mm-12mm). The polymer plastic that we found to be the least stretchable was plastic C which actually shrank, it went from 14mm to 13 mm. Plastic B stretched 1mm and plastic D was impervous to the weight and didn't change/. A couple of ways the students can improve this experiment would be to at more trials to increase the validity and they can specify the actual weight that they used for the experiment.
3297	2	2	2	(a) In conclusion it seems that plastic B has stretched the most because the highest it stretched is 23mm and all the others we lower at 12,14 and 20mm.^p (b) One way the student could have improved their experiment is to tell in the prosedure how long to cut the plastic so they all start at the same size. Therefore these results are not valid because we don't know if they were on even length when they started.
3298	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most in both T1 and T2. ^p b) The students could have improved by stretching it differently, in different ways, that way you can see better, as to which B stretches the best. Another way it could have improved would be by it saying to do things in the same place with the same measurements.
3299	2	1	1	A). The data that  the students recorded is incorrect. ^p B). Two ways the students could have improve  the experiment by adding a control and by adding another performance trial to the experiment.
3300	2	3	3	After looking at the data, it showed that plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm(T1) and 23 mm(T2). Two ways the experiment could have been improved could be to tell us the types of plastics and their starting lengths. Also, to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four.
3301	2	2	2	A) The conclusion I drew based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretches the most.^p B) Two ways the student can improve the design and validity at the results is to state how much weight you  add every five minutes and what types of plastics were used for this experiment.
3302	2	1	1	When looking at the students data I can conclude that plastic type A had the least stretchability reaching (10-12)mm. On the other hand plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability reaching (22-23)mm. Two ways the student could improve his experiment design is: 1 he could have used a control to have a more controlled experiment. 2 he could have done each plastic type with more intervals such as 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes and so on. This would increase the validity of the results.
3303	2	2	2	The student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results by: 1. Having all plastic pieces be the same length. 2. Add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic.
3304	2	3	3	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch. The students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated, and they could have done more trials, so they could have more confidence in their results.
3305	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B is the stretchable polymer plastic. ^p b) The student should have specified a constant length to be used for each trial. Also, the students should have specified the weight being used.
3306	2	2	2	A) 1 After looking at the students data their conclusion may be, Plastic type ''B'' stretches as the most because in T1 stretched 22 mm and on T2 it got 23. Comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23. ^p B) Two ways the students could improved their experimental design are. ^p 1) Do it again. ^p 2) Compare their results with another group.
3308	2	1	1	A) The students data shows that polymers B & D were the stretchiest while the plastic types A & C were not that flexible. B) The student could have improved his/her experimental design by using a control which he/she can compare the results to a plastic used. The student may also perform more trials in order to get an averge amount stretched (mm).
3309	2	3	3	I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more. One way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights. ( We didn't know the weight of them). They could have also repeated the trials.
3310	2	2	2	a.) It is evident that polymer D had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trials. It is ultimately the most flexible/stretchable substance out of the 4 given in the experiment. ^p b) 1) The polymer should be attached with a sturdier applicant than tape. ^p 2.) The ammount of added weight should be specified.
3311	2	2	2	(A) In conclusion I think that the plastic type "B" stretched the most, and plastic "A" is the least stretchable. ^p (B) Two ways the students could have improven the experiment was by one telling us what type of plastic to use, and two, telling us how fare to hang it of the table,
3313	2	2	2	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of the four types tested. In order to improve experimental design or validity of the results the student could have specified and exact number or weights added to the clam, and the kind or weights and exact weight that he was adding to each piece of plastic. Also, he could have measured each piece or plastic exactly the same in order to be more precise.
3314	2	3	3	A) Based on the students data plastic B is the most stretchability and plastic A is the less stretchable plastic. ^p B) In the students' experiment they could of stated exactly what was the measurement of the first type of plastic so they can repeat it acceratly for the other plastics. They could of also detemen the exact weigh of the clamp and how much wighed the wightes they add to get an more accerated result for the stretchability of the plastics.
3315	2	1	1	The conclusion is there might have been some problems in the student's experiment. Some validity issuses could be that the five minutes the weights and clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Also, the spot were the plastics were placed could not have been the same spot every time.
3316	2	2	2	A) A conclusion that can be drawn based on this data is plastic type B has a higher stretchability than the other types of plastics. The independent variable is the type of plastic. The dependant variable is how far it can be stretched ^p B)The ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to actually name the plastics and to tell us what the actual length was in the beginning. By telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better. By telling the length of the plastic in the beginning, we could see the change that occured.
3317	2	2	2	a.) The conclusion of this experiment was to find the stretchability of different plastics. In the data results I found that plastic type B has the most stetchability of the four plastics in both trial 1, and trial 2. ^p B.) What were the weight of the weights that were used. How long was the length of the string that was attached to the weights.
3318	2	3	3	Based on the results, plastic A is the least stretchable and plastic B is the most stretchable. The students could improve the experiment by giving the exact amount of weight to be used so that the experiment can be redone it needed. The student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable.
3319	2	1	1	My hypothesis was correct, the second trial didn't stretch the plastics further than the first trial. ^p One way the student could have improved the experiment would be describing the length of the plastics before being stretched. Second, the student could have also allowed the plastics to hang for a longer period of time to gather more accurate results.
3320	2	1	1	Based on the following data on the polymer investigation, I can make a conclusion that the plastic D type is the most stretchy. Also the trials very similar but only average by 12 mm because the stretchyness. either increased or decreased. If a student were to complete this experiment all over again I would suggest that they change the way they set up the experiment because it was very complicated which leads to many errors. The students should also test the experiment 2 more times to see a range of results.
3321	2	2	2	The conclusion that I have drawn from this expirament is that plastic type B was able to stretch the most. One way the student could have improved this experiment would have been they could have done a third trial to ensure the validity of the plastics' strechability. The student also could have been more specific in their procedure. They should have specified the plastic type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in their experiment.
3323	2	2	2	A)What the data table shows is that plastic type A and B stretched additional length in trial second trial. Plastic C stretched length in trial two and D didn't stretch farther in trial two then one.^p (B)They can increase the number of trials for those experiment, furthermore they should give the exact amount of the weight the use for experiment using grams.
3324	2	2	2	Based on this data i can conclude that plastic typ B was the most stretchable at 22mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. One way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3. And another way to improve the validity is instead of timing, you should see how much weight it can hold before breaking by adding more weight at intervals.
3325	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can examin that plastic type D was prefarrened correctly because the 2 trials recorded the same length but plastic type B stretched farthest. Two ways the student could improve the experimental design/or validity is to create more trials to test the stretch and also state the weight size and make sure he put the exact weight measure for each plastic type and trial tested.
3326	2	2	2	According to the data shown plastic type B was the strongest and plastic type A was the least strongest. The groups' experimental design would of been positively improved if they include what plastic they were using instead of saying " one type of plastic " if the group included the original length of the plastic it would of much both their experiment and validity better.
3327	2	1	1	Based on the student data it shows that T2 and T1 are showing that most of the experiments change on the second trial, and a couple stayed the same as the first trial. ^P The students could have improved their experiment by listing what the type of plastic is on the graph. They also showed have wieghed each weight to make sure they are all the same. They also could have hung the wights from the same distance on the plastic.
3328	2	2	2	a) Plastic A stretched out the most with 2 mm. b) The student could have had another trial to test validity. And also have started out with the same length for every plastic.
3329	2	2	2	A) Based on the table below I can infer that T2 stretched out more than T1. ^p B) Two way the student could have impral there exerimanta is is one thy could have gave how long the plastic was befor they stretched it so I can now the amount of the length stretched. Another thing word have to be is what they taped it the should of have used something more stronger lile another clamp for both end of th plastic and on each end.
3330	2	1	1	The sample of plastic A stretch the least, meaning it was the strongest. The sample of plastic D stretch the most, meaning it was the weakest. ^P The student could have improve the experiment by having a control sample plastic A,B,C, and D, with no added weights. Another way to improve this experiment would be to have more trials for each kind of plastis.
3331	2	0	0	In conclution, plastic type A and B did stretch but plastic type C got smaller and plastic type D stayed the same. ^p The student could have found another way to stretch the plastics. Their data could have been put clearer also.
3332	2	0	0	In conclusion what all of the plastic type (A,B,C,D) stretched at least a milimeter per trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to have a controlled sample for each type plastic before they were stretched and the student should have been more specific about  what type of plastic they used.
3333	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type D was stretched the most. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to vary the weights and amounts placed on the plastic, and to vary the time for  the trials.
3334	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic Type B is the most stretchable and sturdy polymer just because it stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved The experimental design and/or validity of the results would be by including in the procedure, the size of the weights used and the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment. Also he/she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
3335	2	2	2	A. Plastic type 'D' had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested. ^p B. They should have been more specific about their mass (g) of the weights used. They should have also stated how long their plastic samples were at the beginning of the experiment, and how long after they were stretched.
3336	2	2	2	Conclusion; plastics B+D stretch significantly more than plastics A+C. The students could have improved their design by starting with plastics of all the same length. They also should  named a common value for all the weights.
3337	2	3	3	a. That substance B streached the fastest and then D, then C and finally A would streatch the least amount. ^p b. The student could have given the orginal length of the plastics. The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed.
3338	2	3	3	A) From this data, it can be concluded that plastic type B is the most flexible because it has the longest length stretched in both trial 1 and 2 additionally. Plastic type A is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials. B) One way the experimental design could be improved is by adding more trials for each plastic because more trials lead to more accurate results. Additionally the design could show how much weight is used on each plastic because if the weights are not the same for each plastic and trial, the results are clearly not valid.
3339	2	3	3	In conclusion type A is the strongest plastic and type B is the weakest plastic. ^P In this experiment they should have more trials than just 2. ^P They also should have put how much weight they used and if it was the same amount of weights.
3340	2	2	2	The conclusion that was drawn was that plastic type (A) had the longest length after being stretched with weights. The students could have improved the experiment by having more than two trials, and also by being more specific about the amount of weights that were used.
3341	2	2	2	Plastic type D is the most durable. It had the most amount stretched. The student should have wrote in the measurements of the before stretched length and how many weights to add when stretched.
3342	2	3	3	a) Based on the results, plastie type A was the least flexible, while plastic type B was the most flexible. ^p b) 1) The student doesn't say where on the table to tape the tap edge of the sample. 2: The student uses samples with varying length, therefore making his results invalid.
3343	2	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type B stretch the farthest than the others. Two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags.
3344	2	3	3	According to the data, plastic B seems to have stretched the most, while plastic A stretched the least. ^p The experiment could be improved in two ways: The plastics' length was not constant and will affect the results. The plastics should be a set length. The weight of the weights should be specified so that others may similarly recreate the procedure.
3345	2	3	3	A conclusion I can draw, based on the start ends data, is that plastic type B had stretched the most at the end of both trials. Also, I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials. They could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights, type of clamp, and the height that the plastic hung from.
3346	2	2	2	a) One conclusion that can be made is that the strongest plastic is "A" because it stretched the least in both trials. b) One way the students could have improved this experiment would have been to also test a control. This experiment needs something to compare  to or else the results are not totally valid. Something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure. Most of the procedure is very vague it would be quite different to try to re-perform this experiment with this procedure. For example, the procedure says: " Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes". The reader does not know the weight or size of the weights her does he know where to put them.
3347	2	3	3	a) The conclusion has been drawn that plastic type B stretches the most.^p b) Two ways to improve this experiment would be be tell how long to cut each plastic and how heavy the weights should be.
3348	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type because the strogest  because it was the strongest the first and second trail. ^p They could have made none trails and add more weights on the plastic see how had it works.
3349	2	2	2	Based on the students data i ca n say that plastic A was the strongest because it barely stretched. Two ways in which the experimental design/ validity of the results could have been improved were to label the plastics and in put the length of the plastic before it  was stretched.
3350	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most out of all the plastics. Therefore plastic type B is the weakest. ^P b. two ways the students could have improved their experiment is clampy how much weight is put on to the clamps. Also, they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate.
3351	2	3	3	Based upon the students data, + displays that plastic type B is the most flexible compared to the other three types of plastic. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to do the standard 3 trials, instead of two and also to further improve the student's validing of their results would be to record a before and after measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid.
3352	2	3	3	The plastic that stretched the most was B.^ This student could improve by recordin the amount of weight used and having the same amount of weight for each, they could have also added the length of the plastics to show.
3353	2	1	1	The conclusion I can draw from based on the student's data is that A.B increased, while C decreased and D stayed the same. 2 ways the student could have improved the experiment is by 1st the way the decided to do the experiment. They should have checked to see if after the 1st trial if it would go back to its normal form. 2nd: They should have mentioned what the size was before the experiment was started.
3354	2	1	1	Plastic D is concictast with how much it stretches state that they are using different plastics state the weight that was added.
3355	2	1	1	I conclude plastic polymer D has the most stretchability and polymer plastic A has the least stretchability. The student should have ran two test on each plastic with a brand new piece then averaged the totals together for (T1) and (T2) for each trial. The student also should have set how this piece of plastic is "hanging freely" that tells me nothing or how to repeat it.
3356	2	3	3	a) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable because for both trials it stretched more than all the other plastic types. b) Two ways the student could have improved the design could be to specify how many weights they added to the clamp and they could of also used something sturdier stronger to hold down the plastic so it wouldn't come off the table.
3357	2	2	2	a) Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most by 22-23 mm and plastic A stretched the least with about 11mm. Plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic with 13-14 mm.  b) The students could have improved the experiment by recording the average amount stretched. They also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length.
3358	2	3	3	a. Plastic type A was mide of the least amount of polymers because it stretched the least, and plastic B was the most. ^p b. The students could have written the measurements of the plastics before they stretched them, and they also could have specified how much weight they held part on the clamps.
3359	2	2	2	a) According to the results, T2 had stretched the most mm than T1.^p B) The student should have said how big the clamp should have been, and how heavy the weights should have been.
3360	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretched the most of all. They should have specified the mass of the weights used.
3361	2	3	3	Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability. It had the most streching for both the first and second trial, 22mm and 23 mm. To improve this experiment I would specify how much weight used in each type of plastic and I'd make that a controled variable. I would also include the length of the plastic before it was stretched so I can get a better idea on how stretchable the plastic really is
3362	2	3	3	A) Based on the data I have seen, plastic B seemed to be stretched out the most, meaning it's too durable. And plastic A seemed to be stretched out the least, meaning it's more durable. ^p B) One way to improve this experiment is by telling us the amount of weight the student added to the clamp. Also, to get better results the student should've conducted a third trial.
3363	2	2	2	Based on the data that is recorded is that they are different here of them had the same length when starting and plastic A stretched the most. ^p This students could  improve this experiment by having the four sample all the same length also to could at told us how much the weights should be and should not change.
3364	2	2	2	a.) Plastic type B stretched the furthest with 22 mm on T1 and 23 mm on T2. Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm on T1 and 12mm on T2. ^p b.) One way would to have the same starting length for each plastic. A second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less.
3366	2	0	0	Well the "T2" was higher except for "C" ^p The student could have told us how much time we have in between before we check again.
3367	2	2	2	(A) Based on the students data it shows that plastic type B is the best choice because it stretched up to 23mm which is farther than the others. ^p (B) The two ways that they can make the experiment better are adding more trials, and adding more controls to make sure that everything is constant.
3369	2	3	3	Plastic B was the most stretchable .It stretched 22 mm that and 23mm that 12 plastic A was the least stretchable.It only stretched 10mm in Trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2.Plastic D was the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in the first trial and 20mm in the 2nd trial. And  plastic C was the 3rd stretchest with 14mm in the 1st and 2nd 13mm in the 2nd trial to improve the experiment they could have used the same length of plastic preceding the stretching.
3370	2	0	0	Plastic Type D stretched the most but on the second trial plastic Type A made the most difference. To improve this project the student could have hung the plastic from a higher surface to see if gravity would stretch it more. Also, the student could have put weights in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable.
3374	2	1	1	(A) Plastic type A had the most resistance it did not rip that much especially compared to plastic type B. ^P (B) Instead of letting them hang for 5 minutes make it less to be more effective.
3375	2	0	0	My conclusion is that plastic type D is best because the amount stretched stayed the same throughout test trial 1 and test trial 2. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is allow the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes, and or add a heavier weight.
3376	2	1	1	a) Some plastics could stretch alot more than others. Plastic B stretched the most. ^p b. The students could added different weights on it and see if that changed the results.
3377	2	3	3	According to the student's data plastic types B seems to be the most stretchable and plastic type A seems to be the most durable. I think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount.
3378	2	2	2	(A) Based on the data, plastic material A was the most durable out of the four tested. This is because plastic A only stretched 10mm on the first trial, and 12 on the second, while plastic B stretched 22 & 23mm, plastic C 14 and 13, and plastic D 20 each time. This means that plastic A tolerated the weight on the clamp the best, and also that plastic B tolerated it the least. ^p (B) The students could have improved their experiment by using a variety of different weights to get a wider range of data, and by doing more trials to allow for the most accurate data possible.
3379	2	0	0	I think they should of kept the time the same because on this chart the times are differnt then the original time. So deffentally improve by keeping the time same.
3380	2	2	2	a) After viewing the data, it is clear that type B has the greatest stretchability with 22mm and 23mm, compared to type A's 10 mm and 12 mm. Also type D is the most accurate because 20 mm was reached in both trials. ^p b) This student can improve the design by specifying how many of what amount weight he used. This will give him more control over the experiment. Also, he should have a control plastic to compare the results of the others to. The control should be either stretchable or very durable.
3381	2	1	1	My conclusion is that plastic type is going to be more long because it look as if the student added more weight to it. The student could have improve this assignment by stating spicifically how much weight to add to the clamp, also this experiment could of been more successful if the student had different type of plastic sample to measure.
3382	2	2	2	Conclusion type B of the plastic was the least strong and stetches the most type of was the strongest and only stetched about mm. Two wats the student could of improve the experimental disen would have more trials and what is the length of the plastic.
3384	2	0	0	Conclusion : Type D plastic has more stretchability because the a mount stretched is 20: T1 & 20: T2. On the first step the should be more specific for the type of plastic. & for the fift step should include in what direction to measure the plastic type after re moving the weights.
3385	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way to improve the experimental design is to make sure the, same amount of weight is used for each plastic. Another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial.
3386	2	1	1	A. Plastic type A was 11mm that had changed the most. From trial 1 to trial 2 it had increased by a going from 10 to 12. ^p B: One way the students could ad improved they're experiment is by doing more track. Another way the students could ad improved there experiment is by adding heavyer weights to the bags.
3387	2	3	3	A) A conclusion that I can draw from the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the most. I know this is accurate because during the second trial it come to be about the same. ^p B) To ways the student could have improved the experiment are ^p 1) He/she should have added how much each weighed and 2) He/she should have put the lengths of the plastics before they were stretched in her data.
3388	2	2	2	Considering the plastic was already stretched. It wasn't as strong as it should of been on the second trial. The student could of told how long the plastic was before it was stretched. He could of also told how heavy the weights were.
3389	2	0	0	The way they could had improved the experimental design or the validity results is by adding more to it to make it higher than it is.
3390	2	0	0	I conclude that all plastic type stretchability is good except D. The students could had improved the experimental design by all of the plastic being known in prior knowledge that it would stretch. Another way would be that they could of see how much of something it could hold.
3391	2	2	2	Plastic types And C were stiffer while types B and D stretched more. This student could have supposed this experiment by adding a third trial for more accurat data and by adding the original length of each peice of plastic to table that he  made. The original length would better the understanding of the data by whoever is reading the table because they would be able to see what length the plastic started at.
3392	2	1	1	1 way this student could have improvert this experiment B by doing more trials so their results done out better. Also they could have hung the weights for a longer period of time.
3393	2	2	2	In conclusion trial any
3394	2	1	1	The amount of stretched in T1 and T2 nie was a little different, T2 was greater than T1 in plastics A,B and C, but in plastic D they had the same amount of stretched. ^p What the student shoud do to improve his experiment is to add more trials.
3395	2	3	3	Based on the results of the experiment, plastic type B had the least overall stretch. Although the groups results are not valid. There are two ways to improve the experiment in an experiment, you should always construct 3 trials to validate your results also, all of the samples should be exactly the same length.
3396	2	2	2	A) Plastic B stretched the most out of all therefore plastic B has the greatest level of stretchability.^p B) The studen could have changed the tested variable the 2nd trial or he/she could have preformed an additional trial.
3397	2	2	2	To improve the validity of the trial, the student could add another trial for each of the plastic strips. To improve the experimental design, the student should mention the exact amount of the weights used on the plastic.
3399	2	2	2	Conclusion: There was a small difference between the first and second trial for each plastic. The student could have improved the validity by doing a third trial. They could of improved the experimental design by stating how much each weighted weighed.
3400	2	2	2	Plastic B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics. ^p The student could have specified what weight to use, so each plastic is being pulled with by the same weight. Different weights would affect accuracy negatively. The student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested. For example, if a plastic was heated before the test it would stretch much more than a plastic that was cooled lastly. The student could make sure each test was in same environment.
3401	2	0	0	B) One thing they could've improved on would be the description on the steps, explain it more with detail. Another thing the students could work on would be to define the control. ^p A) Polymer Investigation.
3402	2	3	3	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve experimental design and validity, the student should have specified how much weight he used to put on the ends of the clamps to stretch the plastic. Also, there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end. Also, there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid.
3403	2	1	1	The conclusion
3404	2	1	1	a) A conclusion of this procedure would indicate the plastics durbility to a certain amount of weight and which if the plastics is more durable or unstretched than the others. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experimental design would be stating the types of plastic used. Another way would be by determining how heavy the weights were on the clamps.
3405	2	2	2	In conclusion, based on these lab results plastic type B was stretched the farthest where Plastic A was stretched the least. One thing the student should do to improve their experimental design was list what kind of plastics they were instead of just naming them plastic A, plastic B etc. Also to improve their validity of the experiment they should have done twice trial to make sure that the first type trials were right.
3406	2	1	1	A conclusion of the student's rest of stretchability on polymers is, plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched out the most out off all the other plastics. Plastic type A would be the least stretchiest because it stretched out the least out of all the other plastic types. 2 ways the students could have improved the results are; increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results; are increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results, The second way is add more weights when stretching out the plastics so you can see how they react under more weight pressure.
3407	2	3	3	According to this data table plastic type B has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type A. ^p B. Torbe more accurate say how much the weight weighs and that you have been using the same for the same amount of time. Also, make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic.
3408	2	0	0	The type stretched out differently depending on how much weight was put on them.
3409	2	1	1	Plastic polymer D has the most stretchability. It is more durable. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design an validity of the results, would be to have a few more trials and test the plastics for 10 minutes.
3410	2	1	1	In conclusion plastic type D based on our data stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. Type D stretched 20 for both trials while type a stretched10 for TI and 12 for T2. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial. Also to average the data out.
3412	2	2	2	A) The conclusion I can conclude from the data is that plastic B stretched the farthest, in both of the trials. ^P B) More trials. ^P Add another type of plastic.
3413	2	3	3	a)Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability, it stretched 22 and 23mm in both trials, while the other plastics stretched between 10 and 20 mm. ^p (b)The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials and by measuring mass of the weights.
3415	2	3	3	a) Plastic type b was the only polymer plastic that was able to stretch out the most while plastic type A was the only polymer plastic that did not stretch out a lot. ^p b) One way that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to state how many weighs to add on the clamp. Another way that it could've been improved was to do more trials.
3416	2	2	2	A conclusion to be drawn is plastic type B is the most strechy and plastic A is the strongest. Two ways to improve the experiment would be not say "exatly" and instant say "repeat steps" and to keep the length and width of the plastics constant
3417	2	2	2	a) A conclusion that I can draw based on the students data is that plastic "B" stretches alot more then any of the other plastics and plastic "a" is the least stretchy. I know that because plastic B's lowest trial was trial 1 with 22mm stretched whitch  higher than any of the others on the data table. Also plastic "a's" highest was in trial 2 at 12mm stretched and that the lowest on the board (besides its own t1). As you can see the conclusion I drew and why it is an accurate one. B.) Two ways it could have been improved was by - doing 3 trials bc the more trials the more accurate the experiment is and you're supposed to do 3. - he should have allowed the them to hang for more then 5 minutes in step 4. This way it will have more time to stretch.
3418	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, the order of stretchability for the plastic types from greatest to least is B, D, C, A. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results would've been to use the same clamp for all the experiments and to use the same amount of weights.
3420	2	0	0	Both plastic types B and D stretched out of all the plastic types. He could have listed all materials first. Also he could have timed longer.
3421	2	2	2	The purpose for this experiment was to investigate which of four polymer plastics is best in terms of stretchability. According to the data table, plastic type B is higher regarding stretchability having the most mm's  in trial 1(22mm) and trial 2 (23 mm) while the least stretchable is plastic A having 10 mm in trial 1 and 12 mm in trial 2. Two way of improving result validity would be by testing not just stretchability but abrasion and other technique, 2) increasing the amount of trial for greater data.
3422	2	2	2	According to the data, plastic type D was most likely a hard type of plastic such as a water bottle or milk jug because it didn't stretch at all. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment would be to add the constant of how much weight was added. This is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same. A second way to improve the experiment is to use the same amount of plastic to make each trial more valid and similar.
3423	2	3	3	Plastic type B was the most stretchiest (22&23) & plastic type A stretched the least. Plastic type C (A&B) stretched the second least while plastic type D stretched the second most and was constant with 20mm. The students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results. More trials can show a trend in the data while only two can't. The students also should have clarified how much the weights should weigh when added and when to add them to the clamp.
3424	2	1	1	After reading the recorded data from the investigation I can conclude that out of plastics A,B,C, and D plastic A and B both increased in milemeters opposed to C which decreased after the second trial while plastic D stayed the same during both trials. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by leaving the the clamps on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes, another would be to perform  a third trial.
3425	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable with 22mm and plastic type A is the least stretchy, it only stretched 10mm. However in order for this experiment to be more valid you would have to keep the amount of weight and the length of each plastic the same if you were to do this, then you cold get a more accurate data.
3426	2	0	0	A. Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B. One way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong.  Another way was to create a graph.
3427	2	0	0	My conclusion from the data is that A streched 2mm, B streched 1mm, C streched 1mm and D stayed the same at 20mm. ^p Name the plastic being used. Add how much each plastic streched.
3428	2	3	3	Based on the students data, plastic type B is the stretchiest. One way they could have improved their experimental design is by creating a controlled length for each of the plastic types. Another way they could have improved the validity of the experiment is by adding more trials, because by performing more trials, flukes will not greatly affect the data.
3429	2	2	2	Based on the student's data you can tell that on plastic type A and is continue to expand after they are streched a second time, while plastic type C and D do not. The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how more weights they added to the plastic and adding a 3rd trial. Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment.
3430	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the table is that plastic type B was the strongest because stretched very much and it did not break. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is specify how much weight to add to the plastics, and tell us how long the plastic samples should be.
3431	2	1	1	Conclusions drawn from this experiment is that plastic type D had stretched the most and is most flexible. While plastic type A had stretched the least and is the least flexible. The student could have stated what the types of plastic were though. So instead of seperating them by letters, who'd know exactly what they are. He should of also said how heavy the weights would be and made sure they were all kept the same weight.
3432	2	1	1	a) The type of plastic that stretched the highest amount of mm was plastic type B with a total of 45 mm. The record trial was more than the first trial as shown on the data table. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experimental design could be to stretch the plastic with your hands. A second way would be to wait more than five minutes to take the clarops off.
3433	2	3	3	Based on the results from the data table, the two trials do not differ much but the second trial had a couple longer length, so something could have been done differently from the first trial. The data should that plastic B stretched the farthest during the first trial and that it is the "stretchiest" the way the student could have improved the design or validity of the results is to repeat it 2 more trials exactly like before to ensure the results are accurate. A second way the student could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to each plastic, instead of just saying changed.
3434	2	3	3	a) In conclusion,plastic (B) streched the most endeng with a total of 45mm of streched plastic the least effective plastic in strechability was plastic (A),only streching a total of 22mm. b) (1) keep the amount of weights constant at a specific measurement.(2) Measure the plastics making them all the exact same size with specific numbers.
3436	2	0	0	Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design  or validity of the results is they could be more specific  and could of wrote a conclusion saying which plastic type has more stretchability instead of drawing a data table. To show how much a the stretchability of each plastic.
3438	2	1	1	a) Plastic type B has the most tensile strength and plastic type A hav the least tensile strength. b) The student could have added a control and specified how much weights were added.
3439	2	2	2	a) Based on this data the students can conclude that plastic B is the stretchiest sample. ^P b) Two ways the students could improve their experiment would be to use a fresh sample for each trial, & they could also ad the same weight consistantancy for each sample.
3440	2	3	3	The conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest. ^p How much weight to rise. ^p Did a third trial.
3442	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the polymer plastic with the highest stretchability because in both trials it had stretched the most. this experiment is not very valid because the different polymer plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it stretches. Also, the measure of the weights weren't specified.
3443	2	2	2	a. Plastic type A was the most streachable of all plastics tested.^b.One way the students could improve the experamental design and validity of the results is if they repeated the test on each plastic several times to ensure their results were correct. Another way that they could improve the design is if they specified amount of weight added to the clamps, then did trials with a different amount of weight.
3444	2	2	2	A) If you tape a plastic sample to a table and attach a clamp with weights on the bottom then plastic type C will stretch the longest because it is the thickest out of all the plastics. ^p B) Two ways the student could improve was to add more trials and make sure to use the same amount of weights for each plastic.
3445	2	2	2	a) The plastic that is most stretchable is plastic B, and the least stretchable is plastic A. ^p b) The student could have put the original length of the plastic into his table without the original length, it is actually impossible to see which one stretched the most. Plastic D looks like it stretched a lot according to the graph, but its original length could have been 20. The length of the plastic samples should also be the same. If there is one sample that is shorter than the others, the results will not be accurate.
3446	2	0	0	a) The conclusion to my investigation is at the end of my investigation plastic D came out even in the second trail for (T1) and (T2) when stretch. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by telling us what plastic to use. For example, plastic bottle or wrap. Also, telling us how long do they want the plastic stretched.
3447	2	3	3	A. Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials. Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials. The student did not have a control variable.^P The student could have measured each plastic before adding weights to make a controll each plastic type had to be the same length. Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
3449	2	1	1	Based on the experiment's data the plastics A through C stretched up & down. However plastic type D did not change at all in both trials. Plastic A's amount of stretching went up by 2. Plastic B's stretching amount went up by only one. Plastic type C also only went up by 1. The students could have improved the experiment by having more tests & having a control.
3450	2	2	2	A conclusion for this experiment is that there must have been a possible error somewhere making the data unreliable. This is because the results are inconsistant. ^p One way the student could have improve the experiment is to have done more trials. Another way the student could have improve the experiment is to measure the exact weight put on the clamp.
3451	2	2	2	In this investigation the conclusion is that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. As you can see in the data table plastic type B stretched 22mm in the 1st trial. In the second trial plastic type B stretched 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least in both trials. In the first trial plastic type A stretched 10mm and in the second trial it stretched 12mm. Two ways that this lab could have been improved would be to wait longer than 5 minutes to have them stretched and to make sure they are the same length.
3453	2	2	2	a) Plastic B stretched more than plastics A,C & D when weights are added to it. ^p 1. How much weight was added. 2. What do they measure length in.
3455	2	2	2	During this experiment, it was proven that plastic sample A was the most durable, as it only moved between 10-12mm. The most flexible however, was plastic sample B. It stretched between 22-23mm. To improve the validity of this experiment, I would reccomend  specifying the amount of weight to add to the clamp. So that it can remain constant throughout the experiment.
3456	2	3	3	Type plastic B stretched the longest in (t1) to (T2) having measurements of 22 to 23. Ways the students could improve their design adding measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy the weights are.
3457	2	1	1	I a conclusion based on the students data, is that plastic D streched the same amount at 20mm for trial 1 & trial 2. But plastic B streched the most. For trials 1&2 at 22mm for trial 1, and 23mm for trial 2.
3458	2	1	1	In conclusion plastic type D was the most strechable (streched 20mm) and A was the least (streched 10mm). Therefor type D would be the best choice. The design could be improved by adding a controlled, and by adding the new much the weights were.
3459	2	0	0	a)Our hypothesis was collect that plastic type would stretch the farthest because it is the most durable.^p (b)One way to improve their design was to add more to step seven like "repeat steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic".
3460	2	3	3	A) A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable whereas type a is the least and is more resiliant.^p B) Two ways to improve the validity include adding a third because the data is different in the first 2 and a third would confirm accuracy a little more. Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples. The same size before stretching specifying what meraments to go up by in weight added and specific amount of weight to add must be the same.
3461	2	3	3	In the conclusion of the experiment plastic type B stretched the most to 22 mm to 23 mm. While I thought plastic type A streched the least 10 & 12 mm. Two ways that these students can improve their experimental design would be having more variables controlled such as how much weight to put on to the clamps. Also, the students got include the starting size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data.
3462	2	1	1	(a) My conclusion in this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all the polymers tested. In both trials, it had the most amount stretched, trial 1 it was stretched 22mm and trial 2 was stretched 23mm. (b) The student could have improved the experimental design in two ways by having a control and by including constant variables. The control would serve as a reference point to the rest of the data and constant variables would have made it so no other variables were affecting the results of the experiments.
3463	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched to 22 and 23mm. ^p The student could specify the amount of plastic that was hanging over the edge. The student could also say how much weight he was using.
3464	2	3	3	In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability while type A has the lowest. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to have a specific weight such as 1 1b, 2 1b, 3 1b. Another way would be to add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results.
3465	2	2	2	One conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B stretched the most (22 mm and 23 mm) out of all the plastics. Also, plastic type A stretched the least, only stretching to 10 mm and 12 mm. This is a conclusion that can be drawn. ^p To improve the validity of the experiment, the students could name the four plastics used. Also to have accurate data, the kids should have set a measurement at which to cut all the plastics instead of saying ''measure its length''. Also adding a control would be helpful as well. This is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment.
3466	2	1	1	A conclusion that can be drawn from these student data could be that plastic type D appears to be the most reliable, or stretchs the most. Two ways these students could have improved their design is they could have done more trials and also they could have kept adding weights and see where plastic broke first. and which held out the longest  could have been the strongest.
3467	2	1	1	My conclusion about the students data would be the farthest amount stretched he recorded one thing I would have done would be to change the plastic to which is more durable and Add T3 so their can be more results.
3470	2	2	2	If I look four plastic cups and taped them from the side of the table and place different contents such as weights. Then the plastic cups will stretch. Based on my results my hypothesis was correct because trial 1 and trial 2 shows that the plastic cups had stretched. For example, plastic type A stretched 10mm in trial1 after adding weights to the clamp and letting it hang for five minutes. They could have improved the this experiment by giving the length of the cup before the cup and then they could have just measured it again and see what it was after. For example before 30 after 40. They also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment.
3471	2	2	2	Based on the students data you, can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest of all the plastics. If the students are to conduct the experiment again, they could improve their experimental design by using heavier weights and also doing more trials.
3473	2	1	1	After looking at the data I can conclude that plastic was D was the stronger the plastic because it stayed the same length. ^p B. two ways they could have improved the job is by first stating what type of plastic you are using and by saying how much weight you have to the clamp.
3474	2	3	3	a)From viewing data from me polymer investigation, it shows that plastic type B truly has the most stretchability, because it stretched the most out of all the polymers at average of 22.5 mm.^p (b)The experimental design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. Another thing that you could have done was specified how much weight your adding, and if its the same amount for all plastics.
3475	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D didn't stretch all all because the (mm) length hasn't changed. One way they could have improved the experiment is by telling us kind of plastic they used. Another way is that they could have told us how heavy the weights were that they were using.
3476	2	0	0	In the conclusion, the plastic strech out longest in T2 the T1. ^P The way they could of make there expriment better is by ading more weght every jeswon with the same timty.
3477	2	2	2	According to the students data plastic type B is the strongest. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design validity of the results were. By stating the length and type of each plastic . The student hover clarified the length of each btn p of plastic. Another thing, the student should have done is stated how much weight to hang off of each strip of plastic and if it was the same each time.
3478	2	2	2	A conclusion I draw based on their data is that plastic type D is the most durable and strongest plastic. It didn't change in either trial. An improvement the students could have done made was recording the original lengths of the plastics before it went through the test. Also, they could have recorded the amount of weight they added to the clamp in order to see what caused the plastics to stretched. Validity of the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastics to hang.
3479	2	3	3	According to the students data, type B polymer plastic stretched the furthest. The students could have improved this experiment by adding more trials and more sure that in step 2 that all the plastic samples were changing freely down the side of the table evenly by measuring the parts taped.
3481	2	0	0	The student used different plastic to determine its stretchability. She took a sample of one of the plastic & measured, she added weights on the plastic to see how far it would on.
3482	2	3	3	A plastic B is more stretchable than plastic A, C and D. The student didn't mess up anywhere during the expierement otherwise there would be a bigger gape on the strecbility between two trials. ^p B The student should use the same amount of weights for each plastic and should have done a third trial.
3483	2	3	3	A) A conclusion I could come up with in this experiment is that plastic type B has stretched 22-23mm which makes it the most stretched but out of the 4 they tested in both trials. While plastic type A had the least stretchability at 10 & 12mm. B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is they should have done at least 3 or more trials to better the information given. They also should have made sure in step 2 that each plastic was hanging off the table at the same length so it would be a fair way to measure at the end.
3484	2	1	1	Plastic type B has the most stretchability during both trials. Plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability in both trials. The student could have explained how the plastic stayed on the table if there were weights attached. Also what kind of table the experiment took place on.
3485	2	1	1	Based on the student's data both plastics type A and B has increased in T2, type C has dicreased in T2 and type D stayed the same. ^p Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is add more control and make more trials.
3486	2	2	2	In conclusion, scene within the data toble plastic type b was most durable in being stretched. making plastic b have the most stretchability. This expirement could of been improved by having a control of how far each plastic could be streached with out weights, secondly they could have told us in the ditecting and in use smaller weight or larger weights, and actual length sizes so the expirerment could be done right.
3487	2	1	1	One way the student could have imomised the experiment is to try the trials more than once.
3488	2	2	2	a) Based on the exploits data, plastic type A stretched the farthest from trial 1 to trial 2 and plastic type B shrinkid from
3489	2	3	3	Plastic
3490	2	2	2	a) Plastic type b stretched the furthest out of the grap. ^p b) give the specific name of the plastics used tell us what size weights to use.
3492	2	2	2	a)Based on the data,plastic D had the greatest stretchability with an over age of 20mm streched.This was much greater than plastic A, which had the lowest average amount stretched which was 11mm. Plastic B and C tell in the middle .^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment design would to specify the amount of weights used and make sure it was the same each time.The students should also specified how to hang the plastics off the table so that the same amount was on the table as was hanging off.
3493	2	1	1	based on the students data I can conclude that the second time the trial was done the amount that the plastic types stretched was greater than that of trial one except for type C which it shrink 1mm from 14 to 13 in trial 2. Two ways they could have made this experiment better is if they were specific on how much weight was used, and if in the chart they included the amount of time that each plastic type hong.
3494	2	1	1	The first thing the students should improve the experiment design is instead of attaching clamps to the bottom of the plastic sample they should use small boots to it. Then the second thing they should  is do more trials to the experiment because they probaly won't be happy with the data they already got so I would say do more trials and they might get better results.
3495	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the data is that all the plastic types have ranged around the same number. Two ways the experiment could have been approved is for the different plastic types let the weight hold longer than five minutes. And change the trials.
3496	2	3	3	a. Plastic B stretch the furthest and therefore had the most elasticity ( stretchability). Plastic A was the least stretchy. These results were most likely due to the combination of polymers in each plastic controlling their physical attributes. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design originally  is by stating how long the plastic should be cut to be. So 25 to make the experiment uniform. He should have increased this in his table so people could see how the lengths changed. Then he should have specified how much weight to add to the clamps for consistency.
3497	2	3	3	a) A conclusion to the experiment could be that "plastic type B was able to be stretched the most (22mm, 23mm) when compared to the stretchability  of the after three plastics. ^P b. One way the students could have improved the experiment would be to add in the conclusion the amount of weight they add up to each tag. They could have improved validity by adding another trial.
3498	2	2	2	From the students data you can tell that plastic type A has the best stretchability. Plastic type B and C were the second best stretchability. Also that type D hold no sort of stretchability but could have tried more times to yield better results or they could have told us how much weight did they put on for each clamp for each plastic.
3499	2	3	3	My experiment concludes that out of the four plastic polymers, plastic type B was the stretchiest while plastic type A was the least stretchy. My hypothesis on how the plastic would stretch was correct because I know that plastic type B immediately seemed stretched than other plastic types. The students could have improved their experiment by using a constant length for the plastic and using a contrast weight to stretch it with.
3500	2	2	2	A: The conclusion is that the plastic type B in the second trial stretched the most to 25mm.^p B: The could have added a third trial and control variables.
3501	2	2	2	Looking at the student's data, you can see that plastic type B has the best stretchability. The bag stretched 22 and 23 mm, that is more than any other bag in the two trials. The students could have done one more trial to justify their results. Also, they could have used a different amount of weight.
3502	2	1	1	After testing four different polymere plastics. Plastic type A,B,C.D for their stretchability based on the data table plastic type A stretched 10mm, 11 and 12 mm. T2 plastic B stretched 22mm,T1 and 23mm.T2 plastic C stretched 14 mm 11 and 13mm, T2 and plastic D stretched 20 mm 11and 20 mm T2. Showig me that plastic B has the most stretchability and plastic A has the least.Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was including a control to have something to compare the stretchability of the plastics to, and state what each plastic was.
3503	2	3	3	a) My hypothesis, that plastic type B would stretch the most was correct. B stretched on average 22.5 mm, while the other three ranged from 10-20mm. If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability, I would choose B. ^p b) The experiment would be more valid if I started with the same amount of each substance before doing the trials and it would also be more valid if I complete one or two more trials.
3504	2	1	1	Plastic B is the most stredechable and A is the least stredachable.^p They should vary the weights they had on this elome and also allow them to hens for longer.
3505	2	3	3	(A) According to the students data. The conclusion I can draw is that plastic B had the most strechability it stretched 22 mm in trial one and 2mm in trial two second was plastic d it's strechability was 20mm for both trials and the least stretchabilty was plastic A with 10 in trial one and 12 in trial 2. (B) could have done more trials to compare data to and make trials to compare data to and make sure that each piece of diffrant plastics were the same size.
3506	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic A streched the least, and the plastic type B streached the most, something that could have the experiment better is count how many weights are placed on the clamp. This experiment is not valid because the number of weights isn't given. Another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not.
3507	2	0	0	A. With the student's data you can tell that trials aren't that much different in the amount stretched. ^p B. Two ways the student could have improved the results was add less weight, another thing is let it hang longer.
3508	2	2	2	The students could conclude that plastic "B" has the most stretchability, because it stretched the farthest distance every time.The experiment could have been improved by making all the original pieces of plastic the same length. Also they could have used a control for comparison.
3510	2	2	2	a) Each trial was very close to the same answer as the other one, so it, poves my validity, and shows that the weights does stretch out the plastic.^p b) The student needs to say how long the plastic was before the experiments. He should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere.
3511	2	2	2	According to the students data the conclusion that plastic. Type A stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment by making sure that all the plastics were the same length. Another way he/she could of improved the experiment is by doing is third trial (T3), every experiment that is being investigated should have a third trail (T3) in order to get the correct results.
3513	2	0	0	a) When the experiment was finnish the data showed that the four different polymer plastics for stretchability didn't have different results. The amount the four plastic types stretched in test one and test two were almost the same. ^p b) Two differnt ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity would of bein adding time for the weight to work.
3514	2	1	1	The students data shows that plastic type B hold the most weight and that plastic type A held the least. I think that the student would have added more trials and recorded the average of the trials. he also should have waited until the plastic bioler to record the data instead of waiting for it to get to a certain length. another thing that could have been done is use less time. The student waited five minute before adding another weight when they could have just added until the plastic ripped.
3515	2	2	2	A) The student can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p B) The student could have stated what exactly he was looking for. He could have also added another trial to see a better average because some of them were close.
3516	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, it's safe to say that plastic sample A was the strongest. You can see this because in the chart the plastic was the smallest. One thing the student could've improved was if all the plastic samples were the same size. This way all the pieces of plastic have the same starting point. Another thing the studend could change is taking two samples of each plastic so you weren't testing the same sample twice.
3517	2	3	3	a) From the information in the data table, I can conclude that plastic Type B stretched the greatest, considering that 22 and23 mm is the highest number compared to the rest. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the design are measuring the length of plastic before the trials,and doing one more extra trial to check validity.
3519	2	1	1	Well in this data I can conclude that the amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did the second trial, but plastic D stood the same which was at 20. ^p The student could have made this experiment better by telling us what type of plastics they used. Also they could have said how much the weights, weighed.
3520	2	1	1	a. Plastic type D stretched the most and A stretched the least. ^p b. They could have done a 3rd trial they could explain what brand of plastic each type was.
3522	2	0	0	Plastic type A had the most impact on stretching, type B and C only stretch out one mm longer & type a was the same.^p The student could have added more plastic types and let the weights clamps hang for a longer time.
3524	2	1	1	Based on the students data, I can draw a conclusion that at the end of expirment, plastic type A stretched the longest with 2mm, and type D stretched the least by remaining the same at 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is first tell how much the weights weighed that he added to the clamp. Another way the experimental design could have been improved is by telling what kinds of plastic instead of using type A,B,C and D.
3525	2	2	2	A It is concluded that plastic type A had the most streachability because it increased 2mm in length from being streched, and all the others either grew smaller or barely streched. ^p B Two ways this student could have improved the experimental design would be to have all the plastics begining length the same and also specify how much weight to add to the plastic samples.
3526	2	2	2	A) Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B had the highest amount of plastic stretched compared to the other. ^p B) Two ways students could of  improved this experiment is by dding  materials to make results more reliable . Also, they should of had a control veriable of just the plastic so you can see the results on how far it has stretched.
3527	2	3	3	Based on the data collected by the experiment, plastic type B has the greatest stretchability when attatched to weights. However, there are ways in which this experiment could be improved. The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp. He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also, a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length. Only 2 measurements is not clear, a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic, making the numbers more simple to process.
3528	2	3	3	Plastic type B has more stretchability then plastics A,C or D. Plastic B stretched on average of 22.5mm whereas A averaged it, C averaged 13.5 and D averaged 20. The students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time. The students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length.
3529	2	2	2	A) A conclusion based on the student's data is that between each trail the number stayed the same or increased/ decreased by one.^p ^p B) Two ways the experiment could have improved is for the validity, is to write down the mm it started at and another way is to make sure when adding the weights they are the same found for each trail & plastic type.
3531	2	3	3	Based on these results, I can conclude that plastic "B" has the most stretchability. These results are valid because of the two trials, so I can confidently conclude this. To improve the validity even more would be to use the same length plastic for each type because this may affect the results. Also, the should give a specific weight to add on the procedure instead of just saying "add weights".
3532	2	2	2	The conclusion of this experiments that plastic B is the stretchiest with 22 and 23mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 22.5mm  plastic A was the least stretchy with 10 and 12 mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 11mm. The student could have improved the experiment by performong on trial 3 (T3) for the plastics to ensure validity. Another way could be to let the weights hang even longer or add more weights to each plastic to ensure validity.
3533	2	2	2	A. Based on the data table the polymer plastic with the most stretchability is plastic type B because it was stretched out the  furthest, then the next most stretchy was D, then C, then the least was A. ^p B. Two ways to improve the experimental design or validity of the results are, be more specific; how much weight is being added to the plastics and for T2 I believe that a different amount of weight should be added to the plastic types.
3534	2	0	0	In conclusion plastic A is the strongest and plastic D is the weakest. ^p The student could improve the validity of the results by 1) saying in T1+T2 they used 2 different sets of 4 kinds of plastics. And 2) you can also have at least one other person there to varify this.
3535	2	1	1	A) From this data you can conclude that. There really wasnt much of a change and that T1 bag is stronger. ^p B) The student need an control and also need to be more spcific. when it comes to the weights.
3536	2	3	3	Plastic sample B stretched the farthest.^p The experiment could have been improved by adding exact amount of what to be added on the plastics. Also to measure how much of the plastics edge to be taped to the table so they are standing at the same point.
3537	2	1	1	Repeat the procedure, and use more examples.
3538	2	0	0	To draw a conclusion I would figure out the patium to this data table. B Two way I think the students could of improved on this data table would be to take step eight & make sure they're right.
3539	2	2	2	1) Based on the students data it is conclusive that plastic sample A is the strongest plastic because in trial one it's length was 10mm and in trial 2 it's length was 12mm. Plastic B is the weakest plastic because it's length after weights were added was 22mm, andon the second trial was 23mm. ^P B) The students could have improved the experiment by increasing the time from 5mins to 10mins, and increasing the number of trials with each samples.
3540	2	2	2	The conclusion I drew from the data is that plastics B and D most likely have less rigid polymer structous than A and C. The students could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and including the exact weight of the weights to use. I think the experiment is pretty valid because there are no obvious errors, but the students could increase the validity by doing more trials.
3541	2	2	2	Based on the students results the polymer plastic that was able to stretch the most was plastic B. This student could have improved the validity of the results by finding out the averages of how far each plastic was able to stretch. He could have also noted in his procedure that all the weights most weigh the same so it could be constant. These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid.
3542	2	1	1	Based on the data, plastic type B is the most stretchable polymer. ^p The student could have improved validity by reducing the time in each trial / using less weight.
3543	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most strechable of the four plastics because in T1 it streched 22 mm and in T2 it streched 23 mm. One ways the student could have improved the validity of their results would be to do more trials. One way they could have improved the experimental design would be by specifying the amount of weights to place on the clamps in step 4.
3544	2	3	3	a)The strechiest polymer plastic tested was type B, followed by type C then type A being the least stretchiest^p b)The student could have. Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid. Also the student could use a constant measurement of how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improve it by using a set amount of weights.
3545	2	2	2	Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched the most plastic type A was stretched the last.I think two ways that could have made this lab better is that all the plastic types should all have to be the same length before you add the weights to them and second the procedure should tell you to record that data on a chat the the student did.
3546	2	0	0	A) They should remain the same.^p B) They should take out the weights.^p C) They should work together on the project.
3547	2	2	2	Two ways the student could haved improved the experiment, one is todo more trials. Another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes. ^P The conclusion on for experiment is that plastic type "B" is the weakest because it streched the most and plastic A is the strongest.
3548	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B has the most strechability because, it streched to 22 and 23mm for both trials. Plastics A, C,and D only reached maximum lengths of 12, 13 or 20mm for both trials. ^P b) The students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity by adding more trials or by ensuring that the same length of plastic hangs on the side of the table.
3549	2	1	1	Plastic type A: stretched from 10to 12 increased 2. Plastic type B: stretched from 22 to 23 increased 1. Plastic C: stretched from 14 to 13 decreased 1. Plastic type D: stayed the same. ^P The student could have improved the experiemental design by performing diffrent trials.
3553	2	1	1	a.) The conclusion is that plastic type B had the most amount stretched in both trails and plastic type A had the least amount stretched in both trails. ^p b.) One way the students could have improved their experiment would have to be: Tell what type of plastic they use and another one would be to tell how long they stretched each plastic.
3554	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A increased the more from the first trial to the second trial. It went from 10mm to 12mm. Type C was the only type of plastic that decreased the length. Type D stayed the same at 20mm of length. ^p b) The student could of had a control group which could of been a different type of plastic. Also the student could of had a third trial to see how it would change the amount the plastic was stretched from the first and second trials.
3555	2	2	2	A)My conclusion is if you add more weight the length of the polymers would grow after 5 minutes.^p (B)They can improve by doing more trials, and by listing different polymers they were using. Also they can list wht type of weights they were using and how heavy those weights are.
3556	2	2	2	A) In conclusion plastic type "B" could stretch the most. ^p The students could improve their experiment by more trials and by stretching the plastic more .
3557	2	1	1	Based on the student's data, I conclude that for the second trial, the plastic seem to have stretched slightly more than in the first trial. Also for plastic type "D" the plastic length stayed the same, meaning that it will not stretch any further. ^p b) Two different ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding more trials and more types of plastic to test.
3558	2	0	0	My conclusion is that they did a pretty good job setting up the data table. They not only tried it once they tried it twice. One way they could of done a better job by instead of the data table they shouldn't did a bar graph.
3559	2	1	1	A) I concluded that the stretchability of the plastics have no real difference because the stretchability of the plastics only very by 1 to 2 millimeters.^p B) Two ways the students could have improve the experiment is they could have added a specific amount of weight and they could have let the weights strecth the plastics for a longer period of time.
3560	2	0	0	Extend the time of the weight longer, like about 10 minutes more. Use different materials.
3561	2	1	1	The conclusion based on the student data is that plastic type D is the least stretchable and type A is the most stretchable. ^p To improve the experiment the students should have add more trials and also tested different amounts of weights so they could see how each plastic type reached when even more weight was put on.
3562	2	2	2	It would appear from the data that plastic type B is the most stretch able of all the tested plastics. It stretched on average 2.5 more than the next stretches plastics. One way to improve is say what weight they will apply to each plastics for example 10g, 50g, 100g. Another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics.
3563	2	1	1	A- A conclusion that can be made for this experiment is. In conclusion plastic D would be the strongest type of plastic because according to the data table in both trials plastic D did not stretch. ^p B- Two ways this student could have improved these experiment is by telling us the four different types of plastics used also by telling us how much weight it took to make the plastic stretch and what it is measured in.
3564	2	1	1	Plastic A and D were able to withstand the most weights while B and C were the least. The students could have improved by using a control and doing more trials for more accurate test results.
3565	2	2	2	a. The purpose of this lab is to test 4 different types of polymers to see which polymer is the stretchiest. Based on the results founded, it can be concluded that plastic type B was the stretchiest. In both trial one and trial 2, plastic B stretched the most with 22mm in Ti and 23mm in T2 plastic type A was the least stretchable with T1 and 12mm in T2.^p b. One way the lab could be improved would to have specified an exact width to use in the test. Another possible improvement would be to test for longer amount of time. This should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time.
3566	2	1	1	Based on the student's data, I concluded that the amount each plastic stretch, had varied very little between trials. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiments would be, 1. They could have recorded the plastic samples lengths before they stretched them. 2. They could have and all the original samples to the same length, the started them.
3567	2	1	1	I would say that plastic type B is the most  stretchable type of plastic because in test 1 and 2 it doubled plastic types A and C.
3569	2	1	1	My conclusion is that everytime you put weights on it it would stretch to a greater length. The ways I would improve it is to tell what kind of plastic is most recommended and what is the best length to use.
3570	2	2	2	A conclusion would be plastic type A is the lested stretched with 10 T1mm and 12 T2mm. Also plastic type B had the most stretchability at 22 T1mm, 23m T2. And type C, D were C, 14 T1mm, 13 T2mm, D 20T1mm, 20 T2mm. Two ways the students could hae improvd was to hae a control with no weights on it. To improe and compare data. Also use the same amont of weights for each plastic. To keep data acorte.
3571	2	3	3	The conclusion for this experiments is the plastic the trials the most stretchable: In trial 1 the amount stretched was 22mm. In trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm.  ways the students could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results is to include the length before it was stretched and keep the amount of heights constants.
3574	2	3	3	(a) Polymer plastic B s the stretchiest polymer plastic.^p (b) The student can verify that the lengths of all the plastics are the same at the begining of the experiment to keep samples constant, and he can verify the weights of the weights and clamps to keep variables constant as well.
3575	2	1	1	A). The conclusion would be, that the procedure of this students data had went as planned. All of the results all were around the same number and some were the same. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved on this experiment is to have a control group and also they could of had a third trial to make sure that the results were all correct.
3576	2	2	2	The west flexible type of plastic was type B. On the first trial type B stretched 22 mm while type A hand the least flexibility by only streching 10mm. Also type D was the seacon strechiest plastic but it did not streck on trial 2. One way that yje students could've improved the expirement deating was by saying how much weight to put on the plastic. Their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch.
3577	2	0	0	a- From looking at the student's data from their experiment, trial 2 had better results than trial 1. In trial 2, they could have done the producure more like the instructions tell them to instead of doing half. ^p b- I do not see anything that they couldhave done differently.
3579	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, only 10-12mm thus making it the strongest while plastic type B stretched the most, 22-23mm thus making it the weakest. Could have let the weights hang there for more than 5 minutes to increase validity and had more trials to increase validity.
3580	2	1	1	a) According to the conclusion, plastic type A length stretch more than the rest of the plastics. Plastic A is the most stretchy. ^p b) The student could had added more trials and a can and groups.
3581	2	3	3	From the student's experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most while plastic type A stretched the least. However, these students need to improve their experimental design. Two ways that is possible would be to give definite and constant stretching results for each sample as well as defining how much weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would definitely improve the validity of their results.
3583	2	1	1	A) Plastic D stretched the same lenght in both that but plastic type A is the stretchrest. B) They could have done more thats and, the should have use different weights for more results.
3584	2	2	2	Plastic type B streched the most, in T1 it strech 22mm and in T2 it streched 23mm. Plastic type B streched the same length in T1 and T2, 20mm. Type C streched 14mm in T1, but in T2 strech only 13mm. Type A stretched the lease, in T1 it streched 10mm and in T2 it streched in 12mm. The students can add more more time for the weights to hang. The students can also add a third trial to see witch if type C will remain to strengh and less.
3585	2	1	1	A) Based on the data given, in the second trial, the plastics stretched more than the first. Also, plastic type B and D stretched the most in both trials. ^p B)Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design would be more specific with the procedure and try more trials to average out the results.
3587	2	0	0	Trial D has better performed better.
3588	2	1	1	(A) In contend the data recorded shows that plastic type D stretched the same amount in each trial. ^p (B) The students could have done a third trial they could have also had the weight and clamp hang for a longer time.
3589	2	0	0	My conclasion is that T 2 had a better amount stretched than T 1 had. Also T2 had more plastic types than T1.
3590	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretches the farthest. The students could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial and by specifying how much weight to add to the clamp.
3591	2	0	0	A. Plastic type D is the p
3594	2	2	2	As a conclusion based on the data plastic type B was the more stretchable plastic. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm in trial 2 plastic type stretched 23 mm. Therefore plastic type B has a high stretchability level. B) Two different ways the student could have improved.^p 1) The student could have stated how much the weights weighed and how many to make the experiment more vigor.^p 2) The student could have indicate the trial high because some bags take longer to stretch or/and break.
3595	2	2	2	a) My conclusion is that polymer plastic B had the most stretchability.^p b) Two ways the experiment could have been improved would be.^p 1) Allow the bags to stretch until they break, and record the maximum length each stretched to.^p 2) The students could have specified the weights used.
3597	2	2	2	a)I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most because in the trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm in the first and 12mm in the second trial.^p b)The students could have improved their experiment in several ways. First off that could have identified a specific amount of weight to add on to the clamp.They could have also included a control.
3599	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p b) Two ways that the student could of improved his or her investigation is by saying how many weights will they student put and how much does it weigh . Also, describe how long the plastic  types were before she started her experiment.
3600	2	0	0	A) My conclusion is that the second trial went better than the first because the numbers are much larger than the first. ^P B) The first way is the students could have been more specific on what they did. And the seeena way is they should have said what types of plastics and tapes they was using.
3601	2	1	1	(A) Trial 2 was the one with the most stretchability. Trial 1 was around the trial 2's numbers but trial 2 was a ting but tiger or stayed the same. Plastic C actilly decreased one. ^p (B) They should have tryedengce plastic more trials to see it most would increase or decrease.
3602	2	3	3	a. In conclusion, some of the plastics stretched more than others, however all of them did stretch. Polymer A stretched the least and polymer B stretched the most. From the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch. ^p The student needs to specify how much weight is added and what the starting and ending measurement of each plastic were.
3603	2	0	0	The conclusion of this lab shows that in the first trial the plastic was stretched 2mm. Trial two it was stretched 1mm. Supprisingly in the third trial it actually got smaller by 1mm. Also the last trial it stayed the same length. Two improvements could have been how the students should have made the weights heavier and should have made a clearer data table.
3605	2	0	0	The conclusion based on the student's data is that with trial1 and with trial 2 there were some changes happen the amount of plastic stretched more the second trial than the first. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is in what minute did the stretch begin and what plastic was the strongest.
3606	2	2	2	Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic A is the least stretchable, and plastic B is the most. Plastic A stretched 10mm and 12mm in both trials, which was the smallest length. Plastic B stretched 22mm and 23mm, which was the largest length after five minutes. The students could have improved their experiment, and their results by using plastic samples of the same length, and by allowing the plastic to stretch for a longer period of time.
3607	2	1	1	plastic A was obviously the most susceptials to stretching because it stretche 2 inches, while plastic B only stretched 1, plastic D did not stretch at all, and plastic C lost an inch. This experiment would be more valid if the procedure said how much weight to add to the plastic (so that it was known what it takes to stretch it) and how the plastic was being measured . Although the data table says that the procedure does not.
3608	2	0	0	The conclusion i have drawn is that plastic type D both trials stretched the same amount also that T2 was better. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is by compairing their trials to different plastics and collecting that data.
3609	2	2	2	a. Based on the students data, plastic type B had more stretchability than the others. ^p b. The student could have done more trials or added on more time, for the plastics to stretch longer.
3610	2	3	3	A) Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time. ^p B) The way the students could of improved was they could of conducted more trials to improve the validity of the results also in their procedure they could of said to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment so they all start at the same length.
3611	2	3	3	Plastic B, proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics. Due to it stretching 22mm on the first trial, and 23 mm on the second trial, its average amount stretched to 22.5 mm making it 25mm stretchier the the runner up plastic. ^p One way they could have improved the design of the experiment is by making sure all the plastics used had the same initial length. Also to tell how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to reconduct the experiment to do more trials.
3614	2	1	1	Student will wrap up an conclusion after plastic type & the amount it strech is done. The whole experiment was based on how far each plastic streched and which one streched the first and also the one whiched streched the least. ^p They could have improved it by streching  each plastic three seperate trial and the answer would have been more clear.
3616	2	0	0	A) Plastic B seemed to be the most durable because in it stretched 22mm in t2 it stretched 23mm and the least durable seemed to be plastic A because in T1 only stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm B) They could have specified the type of plastic and long in seconds was the plastic being stretched.
3617	2	2	2	A)From the data ,I am able to conclude that plastic type B is the most durable. Its length stretched to be 22 and 23.This show that it was able to hold the heaviest amount of weights (B) one way the student could improve the experimental design is by using same weights for each plastic .Also the student  should use the same measuring just so they can be reassured that the length of the plastic is accurate for each of the 4 plastics.
3619	2	0	0	Of the four types of plastic A and C stretched about the same amount of weight and D stretched about the same amount. The first way, they could improve the experiment would be to test different amounts of weight. They should also only measure what hangs over the table both times for a more precise result.
3620	2	3	3	a) To conclude, plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics. Type B stretched 22 mm on T1, and 23 mm on T2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type A and C ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm, and type D 20 mm. Type A was the most stretch resistant, so this type of plastic would be the best for grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much the weights attached to the clamp on the plastic weighed, and how long the plastic should be for each type. Should it be the same or different.
3621	2	3	3	Based upon the given data, I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability. The first thing the student needs to fix is in his experimental design, In step 4, (s)he says to "add weight ..." but they don't specify how much  weight to add. The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity. The student needs to record, the starting length of each plastic, as well as keep their length constant. ^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics.
3622	2	3	3	a.Based on the students data plastic B was able to be stretched the most, it was stretched 22 mm the first time and 23 the second.^p (b)First, the student should have stated how much weight to add to the clamp and measured how much the clamp weighed. To get the total weight added would've improved validity. Also the student should have made the plastic sample all the same length so that they started from the same point.
3625	2	2	2	3. A) Base on the data given plastic B stickched for nest. ^p B) The student could have written the starting length of the plastic. He also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment.
3626	2	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type A can stretch the least, because not only did it not stretch anymore in T2 it actually got 1mm shorter. Plastic type A is the best because it can stretch the most. it stretched 2mm more in T2. ^p (b) One way the student could have improved his/her experimental design and/or validity of the results is to include the data on what the plastics measured before he added weights. He could have also included the weights of the weights he added.
3627	2	0	0	a)The amount stretched by T2 showed more improvement by having it stretched because the different material. Both were investigated at the same time. One place was more affected.^p (b)One way is is by maybe leaving it a little longer. Or use different types of weight.
3628	2	3	3	Based on the students data we can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability compared to plastics AC, or D. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm and 23mm in trial 2. All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount. For example, plastic A only stretched 10 & 12mm for trials 1& 2. Ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator. They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant. The length of each plastic shows the same. If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected. Also, the students could have also specified how much like weight is and used the same amount of weights for each one. If one plastic had 21 kg on it and another 31kg, then the one with 31kg may stretch farther not because it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight. This is how they could improve.
3629	2	0	0	A) In conclusion the amount strech T2 streched a little bit more than T1 by 2 mm. I shows that T2 can strech more than T1. ^P B). One way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of used three kinds of different plastics.
3630	2	2	2	a. From the results of the experiment you can see that plastic type B has the highest amount of stretchability while plastic type A has the lowest amount of stretchability.^p b. The students should use the same amount of weights for each plastic. And add a control to the experiment to improve the experiment.
3631	2	2	2	Based on the students data plastic A and B both stretched 1mm more on the second trial but the plastic type that had stretched the most in trial 1 and 2 is plastic B. ^p The student could of improved this experiment by adding the weights but with a certain amount of weight that was used the same on each plastic and trial. Also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go.
3633	2	0	0	(A) My conclusion on the expirement is that, plastic type D has the longest mm stretched out. (B) (1) The student have put the plastic on a hanging string was a steamy, boiling pot of water. (2) Then, the student could have recorded more valid, and improved data on a chart.
3634	2	2	2	By the out come of this experiment, you can tell that plastic B is the stretchiest. Two things that could have been done to improve the experiment are making sure how long the plastics should be in the beginning and if all the plastic types should be the same length before you tape them.
3635	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results are that he should have written the beginning measurements of each piece of plastic, and he should have tested each piece three times not just two.
3636	2	1	1	The two ways that the students could have improved on this experimental design is one what kind of plastic where they using and name each one. The second would be what would you measure the plastic. What type of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance. Also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid.
3638	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B can stretch the most, while A has the most tensile strength because it streched the least. ^p b) The student could have improved their design by having the plastic be the same lenghth for each plastic. For example each could be a foot long. A second change would be to put the same amount on each plastic, for example each could have a lag weight.
3640	2	1	1	My conclusion would be that plastic type (D) would be the most strechy because it went up to 20mm with out tearing. Two ways students could have make the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics and recording the time it took  to stretch .
3641	2	2	2	A. A conclusion I can draw from this is that plastic type A had stretched 22mm the first trial, and 25mm in the second trial making it the most stretchable plastic type. ^p B. I think that this student should have done at least 3 trials. I think this student should have not taped the plastic at the top of the table he should have done it over a bar so both sides could be tested.
3642	2	3	3	a) The plastic thas has the most stretchability is plastic type B a stretch of 22mm in the first trial and in the 23mm in the second trial. Plastic type A has the worst stretchability. Stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial. ^p b) They should have stated and used the same amount of weights for each trial. They also should have used the same amount of each plastic.
3643	2	1	1	a. Based on the student's data, the amount of stretchability in each opastic type was different for trial 1 and 2. (with an exception of type D that remained the same). ^p b. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to clarify the weight of the weight they added on step 4, then for step 6 they should have had clarified the procedure that had to be repeated (ex repeat steps 1-5 exactly for other three plastic plastic samples).
3644	2	1	1	a)I see that the amount stretched of plastic A & B increased on the second trial, but the amount stretched of plastic A decreased and the amount stretched for plastic D remained the same. ^p b) The student could have make a third trial to see what the outcome would be. The student could have made the trials for another period of time so instead of five mns and he does ten minutes for each of them.
3646	2	1	1	A. To conclude, the polymer plastics went through four trials. The data shows that A was averaged to 11, B was averaged to 22.5, C was averaged to 13.5, and D stayed at 20. The plastic type B stretched to most. I predict that if they did a 3-rd trial the numbers would be close. ^p B. The students could of improved if they let the plastic hang for 10 minutes and maybe the results wouldn't be so close. Also, add more details to the procedure.
3648	2	1	1	Students could have made his or her own hypothisis to test. Also should have the procedure more than 2 times.
3650	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. All of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials compared to their first. ^p (b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was to show the length before they were stretched and show the amount of weight added onto the clamps.
3651	2	2	2	The plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type B. It stretched-22mm and the second trial it stretched 23 mm. That shows it has the most durability for stretching. ^p The students should have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at. They should have also included the time on the data table. They should have done various trilas to the e3xperiment.
3652	2	0	0	They could take notes and make a bar graph and put all of it together and come out with the answer. ^p They could use a weight and find out how much the weight by its self.
3653	2	0	0	By the process or doing it, the graph showed me that the amount of stretched of T1 and T2 didn't change, both plastic had the same stretched. And it would change by adding more weights because the plastic wouldn't be resible as the other one.
3654	2	1	1	a) According to my conclusion B was the one who got stretch the longest and A was the shorter one. b) One way they could do this to make it better is by using different plastics type or by duck taping the plastic to a cup and start putting weighs until it breaks.
3655	2	2	2	For plastic type A, the amount stretched increased by one mm. For plastic type D, the amount stretched for trial one and two were the same. With plastic C, the results decreased by one mm. The students could improve their results by repeating more trials. They also didn't mention the measure the plastic be originally.
3656	2	0	0	The conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others. They could improved the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins.
3657	2	2	2	a) plastic type B stretch the most than D then C then A. The second trial all of the plastic began to stretch even more beside plastic C, plastic C didn't increase it's stretching in trial to, actually in trial 1 it stretched more than in trial 2.
3659	2	3	3	A) I would conclude that plastic A is the strangest because it didn't stretch as much as plastics B, C or D. ^p B) One thing the student's could have done to improve their experiment is include exactly how much weight they put on each clamp so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results.
3660	2	2	2	a) Plastic B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^p b) The validity should be improved if the students: -specified how much weight was added to the clamp. -Also specified how high up the table was.
3661	2	2	2	Plastic B happens to stretch the furthis in trial 1 & 2. The student could have used more plastic. Also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy.
3662	2	1	1	A) In conclusion, the student's data that was recorded showed plastic type B capable of stretching the most, than D, than C, & plastic type A stretched the least. ^p B) One way the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results would be by learning a hypothesis. Another thing that could be an improvement is if they varied the times the plastic hanged for up the amount of weight for each type.
3663	2	3	3	a) Based on the student data, plastic B is the most stretchable. Plastic B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while the next most stretched plastic was D, with an average of 20mm. ^p b) To improve validity/design, the student could have conducted more trials. The students also should have specified exactly how heavy the weights used are, so that the experiment is recreatable.
3664	2	2	2	(A) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched. ^p (B) They should've used something more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the table and specify  if all the plastic pieces are the same length and wid therefore they start experimenting on them. They should also say how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights.
3665	2	3	3	By the result of the student's investigation they have concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest polymer of all four and plastic type A is the least stretchiest polymer. ^p Three ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by starting off with each polymer with the same length. The same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2.
3666	2	1	1	A) We can conclude that plastic type B is stronger because on the best trial I only stretched by mm. Then on the second trial it decreased to stretch by 1 more. Picture type A is strong but on the first trial it stretches 10mm, while on the second trial it stretched & mm more. We would rather have the stretch decrease than increase. B) The students could have added more time to the bags being stretched and they could have done more trials.
3667	2	2	2	3.a) In conclusion, plastic  sample B stretched the most when testted for strechability. It stretched nearly twice as much as samples A-C but sample D was close in amount. ^p b) The first way the students could improve their experiment is to specify in how many weights they attached and make sure all the weights weighed the same. they also could have been more specific about the clamp so they can have a control and nothing could effect the validity of the results.
3668	2	3	3	There is not enough data to draw a conclusion from the students data, the students never told us what the starting length of the polymer plastic where and they never told us how much the weight weighed.
3669	2	0	0	For the name of color the plastic.
3670	2	2	2	To conclude the polymer investigation, according to data, plastic A is the Stretchiest. Plastic D is the least stretchy. ^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment is by 1. telling us how long the plastic measured before it was stretched, another way is by 2. how much did the weights weigh?
3671	2	3	3	Based on the students data it shows that plastic type A had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it. In the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14. One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial. Although their test two were similar to end results the third trial would only have made it more valid definitely proving their results are correct. Another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used. Then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment, and it'd give a better understanding.
3674	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be reached based on the student's data would be that the best plastic type to use to prevent breakage of a bag would be type D. It was not stretched at all when the weights were added. One way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to conduct more trials, and the average not the results. This would ensure which plastic is the strongest. Another way to improve validity would be to specify the weight used and know it as a control for each plastic type. These two things must be done to ensure validity.
3675	2	2	2	Based on the data I can conclude that the plastics stretched more in the second trial compared to the first trial. Also I can conclude that plastic B stretched the most because it held the most weight. One way the students can improve the experimental design is to include exactly what plastic they are using. Another way the could improve their experimental design is to include what they are using as weights foreach plastic.
3676	2	1	1	a. The plastic type "B" has the most stretchabilty because in both trials it had a large lengths. ^p b) The student could improve the validity of the results by making sure he kept the same time limit. Also he could made none he did not stretch the plastic by hand when releasing the weights.
3677	2	0	0	The students could of lable the chart better than the did. The could have one add more info to the procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for.
3679	2	1	1	Plastic type A stretches longer than the other plastic types. The student could improve the experiment by putting the name of plastics. And add another trial. 3 trials are always best.
3680	2	2	2	A) I conclude that trial one and two have similar numbers so plastic B and D are the strechiest. ^P B) One way the students could have improved on the validity of the experiment is by using something better than tape to hold the plastic clamp at least tell us the kind and trand of tape. Another way this experiment would be better is if I leneth the weight that tore the plastic.
3681	2	2	2	Plastic type B has the greatest elasticity while plastic type A has lowest. The student could improve validity by having more trials and recording starting (mm).
3682	2	1	1	Conclusion: The students got their information based on the test results, which seem pretty reasonable. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved their experiment was have a control and have more trials.
3683	2	0	0	a. Plastics A and B and C are more stretch resistant than plastic B and D. Also plastic B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. ^p b. One ways they could of told us the IV, OV and the constants of the lab like why they are doing it.
3684	2	1	1	In the end, trial 2 of the experiment had stretched a couple mm longer, a part from plastic D, than trial 1. This experiment can be improved by keeping the weight on for 5 minutes longer to give a better result. Another way it can be improved is doing one more trial to get more results to compare for the lost mass to improve it is adding another plastic type to provide a variety of plastics.
3685	2	3	3	Based on the data we can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest since it stretches the most in both trials. ^p Keep the same length of the plastics of a constant and specified length. Repeat trials again (3rd time).
3686	2	2	2	(A) The strongest plastic was C. ^p (B) They should have recorded the length of the plastic pieces and added it to the data table before testing, and they could have added another test and used more weights.
3687	2	1	1	Plastic type D was the most stretched out of all of the other plastics. The student needed to repeat the steps for a 3rd time also. The student should not have used the same plastic over they should have gotten a new place do the results would show validity to results.
3688	2	3	3	Based on the student's results, the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic B. Both trials it had the highest length. It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment at least one more time. It helps the validity of the experiment. Another way he/she could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics.
3690	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the other four. The students could have ensured that all the plastics are the same length before they begin the experiment. They could have also added specific amounts of weight rather than simply adding a random amount. This would have made the experiment more conclusive.
3691	2	1	1	A) The plastic was stretched, but not a lot, at the most it was stretched two inches. ^p B) They could have said how heavy the weights were, also state what type or brand of plastic is being used.
3692	2	2	2	In conclusion the experiment has even led that the four different polymer plastics neither stretch very  far each trial or didn't stretch very far at all. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results are: Giving us the starting measurements and doing the trial a third time to see   if the results change or show the same.
3693	2	3	3	-The validity of the data is questionable, but one conclusion is that plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p -Two things the students could have done to improve his experimental design/validity of his results are (1) Data certain l
3694	2	3	3	a) Out of all 4 plastics type B was the most stretchable for both trials, D was the second most stretchable, C the third, and A was the least", To improve the experimental design, the student should have specified the length of the plastics and made sure they were all the same continuity and accuracy of the results. Another thing that should have been done is the mass of the weights should have been included and it should have been specified that they were all the same to again ensure accurate results.
3695	2	1	1	3. For the conclusion the students could of put what kind of plastic they used. Also they could made the data table a little more details. ^p The students could have improved their experiment by baming some of the plastics,also they could of put the size of the weights.
3696	2	0	0	Plastic type D stay the same . They should had left more minutes to hang.
3697	2	2	2	A) From the students data table I came to a conclusion that plastic B is more stretchable. ^p B) They could have done more trial and try other plastics.
3698	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p B) The student could have told how much weight they put on the plastic. They could of also explained how plastic types become smaller.
3699	2	1	1	Based on the students data, Plastic type D had the most stretchability it stretched 20mm 0n T1 and stretched the same in T2. While A stretched 2mm and B stretched 1mm and C went from 14mm on T1 and dropped to13mm on T2. ^p The ways the students could've improved the experimental design is by telling us how much weight they used and add more weight.
3700	2	0	0	a) Plastic "D" length did not increase or decrease in both trials. ^P b) One way student ^p could have improved the experimental design by letting it hang for more time to see how it was affected when it stretched. Since their results in both trials were close, they shouldve tested it rersus another.
3702	2	2	2	In conclusion the type of polymer does affect its ability to stretch because plastic types: A & b, indeed did stretch by at least 1-2 (mm). However plastic types: C & D either got smaller (shrinked) or did neither stretch nor decrease but remained the same. ^p Two ways this design could have been improved would be to: have an equal amount of weights placed on all clamps and do more than 2 trials.
3703	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, polymer plastic type B was the most stretchable and polymer plastic type A was the most resistance to stretching, or the strongest. Type B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while type A stretched only an average of 11mm, and types C and D came in the middle, stretching averages of 13.5mm, and 20mm. Type A had the strongest polymer in the plastic and type B had the weakest. ^P b.) The first improvement could have been to include control, by testing the stretchability of the materials or plastics without polymers, or running trials on the same plastics without adding weights, to have a valid comparison to see if the polymers are actually what are affecting their stretchability. The second improvement could be to make sure each plastic is of the same thickness, as that can affect stretchability. They could also use more precise instrument or run more trials.
3704	2	3	3	a.) Plastic type A is stronger and stretches less/ slowest then C,D, and B. ^p b.) Make each plastic the same starting lenth, and the weights are the same weight.
3705	2	3	3	As a conclusion to the data shown on the table, plastic B had the most stretchability. According to the data collected, the information is reliable because, the amount stretched in T!wasn't too different than T2. -The student could've made the experiment more reliable by specifying the exact length of each plastic to start with, and made them all the same. Also the student should've been exact about the weights and made sure it was the same for all of them.
3706	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, followed by types C and D leaving B to be the stretchiest plastic type. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to test at different time periods, and to specify the amount of weight is being added to the clamp.
3708	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic. The students could have improved there design by naming the type of brand of type they used and the amount of it to hold the plastic wrap. Another improvement would be measuring the amount of plastic so that it would be the same amount for each plastic type and using the same weights for each trial so that the results would be correct.
3709	2	2	2	Based
3710	2	2	2	A. Based on the data present in conclusion we can say that plastic type D was the most stretchable plastic type. We can make this conclusion because plastic type D stretched 20mm, the longest:farther than A (12,10mm) ,B(23,22mm) + C(14,13mm).^p B. The students could have used a more study material than tape to tyld up the plastic sample, so it would not affect the stretching of the material. The students also could have specified a specific weight to use for each plastic type, so that they were being pulled the same amount.
3711	2	2	2	According to the students data, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most among the other plastic types, as it stretched 23 mm after that 2. Plastic type A stretched only 12mm, therefore it stretched the least. Plastic types C reached 13mm and plastic type D reached 20mm. B) Two ways in which students could have improved their experiment is by stating exactly how many weights one should add to the clamp, and use a control to improve the valiaty of the results.
3712	2	2	2	Conclusion: In conclusion, polymer plastic B had the most stretchability with 25mm, and polmer plastic A had the least almost of stretchability with 12mm validity. He could of bad more trials, and include plastic types in his procedure.
3713	2	1	1	A) Based on the information it have plastic type B has a high stretchability compared to plastic type A whas stretchability is very low. ^p B) They should've added a materials so we know what they used to do their experiment. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out.
3714	2	0	0	T1 and T2 are very close with their data. They could've increased the time to hang the plastics to ten minutes instead of five. They could have named the plastics.
3715	2	0	0	Due to the data each time the student adds weight the plastic length seem to increase after the amount of time. For example I the type A plastic the first experiment is different their the seemed on because the doings strecht the plastic more after the first trial. The two ways I believe the student should have improved the experiment is by using different kind of plastic and weights.
3716	2	2	2	Based on the student's data plastic type B stretched the most and the 2nd trial (T2) proved that. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are doing a third trial to more fully ensure accuracy and doing something different in the 2nd trial like waiting 10 minutes instead of just 5.
3718	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type D had the most stretchability. The student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results by doing more trials so there can be an average of the amount stretched instead of having 2 measurements that are both different and by stating how much the weight should weigh because different weight size could cause the plastic to stretch more or less.
3719	2	2	2	A) The students plastic seemed to get longer with each trial, except for plastic type C and D which decreased and stayed the same. ^p B) The student could have performed another trial. They also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it. And show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched.
3721	2	2	2	a) Based on the data shown, the polymer plastics will streach but not much. Plastic type A streached out the most out of the four.^p b) One way the students could have improve is by doing more trials. Another way it could be improved is by stating how much the weights weigh & how many are being put onto the plastic.
3722	2	2	2	(A) The conclusion could be that plastic D was the strongest of the plastics because it did not stretch at all. ^p (B) Two ways this exparement could have been improved is by telling how much waright to add to the clamp and the dementions of plastic.
3723	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B had the most stretchability while plastic type A had the least.^p b) All the plastics should be the same length. Make a machine add the weights and remove them and the clamp b/c a human may place the weight w/a different amount of force for every plastic.  Put two clamps instead of tape b/c the tape may evert it's own force while the clamps wont.
3724	2	3	3	A) In conclusion plastic type B was the most stretchable plolymer plastic.^p B) The student could tell you the size of the polymer plastic and make sure all of them are the same size. Also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic.
3725	2	2	2	a) Since there were four different types of plastics, type B seemed to stretch the longest both trails because it is most likely the strongest.^p b) Perform even more trials for validity and be are to keep the clamp, the weights, and wherever you hang the plastic constant for each trial you could also perform a control experiment with no weights.
3726	2	2	2	A) In trial two the plastics stretched more expect for plastic C. ^P B) The students could have done another trial. They could be specific with how much the weights weigh. The students could have named the typed of plastic they used instead of using A,B,C and D.
3727	2	2	2	I could concluded that plastic type B was stretched the most after the experiment which would instate that it is the most flexible. On the other hand plastic type A streched the least meaning it is the least flexible cut of the 4 plastic types. To improve this exerinent the experiment could have had more trials acurate data. The weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results.
3728	2	3	3	A) In conclusion polymer B, is the one that could stretch the most, and polymer A is the one who can't stretch as wide. ^P B) To make the validity of the experiment more accurate than they should of had exact measurment, for example in step 2, the could of said how much it should be hanging by. Also, the could of added another trial, it is always good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes.
3729	2	1	1	a) A conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B is the strongest. Out of all the plastic at 22mm. In the first trial had 23mm in the second trial, because it stretch more than all the other. ^p B) Two the student could have improved the experimenting and / or validity of the result are to add new types of plastics and add more trials to the containers.
3730	2	2	2	Out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability the most stretched was plastic type b. The least amount stretched was plastic a. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/ or validity of the results would have tried different time lengths. maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes. Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics.
3731	2	1	1	A. According to the students data 2/4 of the plastics stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial by the minimum of 1mm.^p B. Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design is 1. They should have taken more trials, at least two more, and 2. They should used more types of plastics.
3732	2	2	2	Based on the data, a conclusion would be that the plastic types pretty much were the same as each trial give or data a mm each trial. ^p This ways the students could have improved the experiment is explain how much the weight weighed and did that weight stay the same for every types of plastic.
3733	2	2	2	In conclusion, based on the data from the chart, each trial for plastics A, B, C, and D were increasing, decreasing or staying the same. The most stretchable would be plastic B . It started off as the stretchiest, before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords. ^p b. The student could have said what types of plastic was used and not just A, B, C or D. He also could have done more than 2 trials, 3 would have been better.
3734	2	1	1	In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest plastic. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 mm while plastic D only stretched to 20mm and C to 14mm. In trial 2 plastic B stretched to 23mm while D only stretched to 20mm and c to 13mm. One way the student could have improved their experimental design was to stretch the plastic until it was about to brake to get the full stretchability. The student could have also done more trials to get more valid results.
3735	2	1	1	1)My conclusion would be that plastic type D stretched the most but not the same amount, the 2nd trial it stretched 1 mm more than the 1st trial. And plastic type A stretched the least, T1: 10 mm and T2:12mm but it stretched 2 mm more in the 2nd trial than the first. ^p Two ways they could have improved the experimental design and for identify of results is they could have made another trial (T3) at least and could have let the weight hang longer than 3 minutes.
3736	2	1	1	A and C did not stretch too far, but B and D stretched much more. The student could have given the beginning lengths in his data, or he could have added more and more weights and seen how far the plastics would stretch.
3737	2	3	3	a) The most plastic type B had the most stretchability in the trial , it stretched 22mm visible plastic type A stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm while type A stretched 12mm. ^p b) The students should had the lengths of the plastics start out he same that way no plastic could be able to hold more weights since it was longer. Students should also specify how many weights are added for five minutes so that way a plastic doesn't stretch more just because it had more weights.
3738	2	0	0	According to the data table plastic type A was the most strechable. Type B and C decreased when measured again after having placed weights and type D stayed the same. Therefore, type A was the most strechable considering the longitude it made by 2mm.
3739	2	2	2	Based on our results of the polymer investigation we found out that plastic type A stretched the most of two mm. Type B stretched the second furthest at 1mm, and type C lost 1 mm and finally type D didn't lose or gain any length. Two ways the student could have improved the validity was to make sure he used the same amount of weight at the end of the plastic and that the plastic was taped at the same spot at the top of the table.
3740	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type B was superior and has more stretch ability than any other plastic type. ^p B) The student could have added more trials to secure the validity that plastic type B had the most stretchability. The student could have drastically improved the experimental design by mentioning how much the weights weigh.
3741	2	1	1	Based on the students data plastics type D stretched the most in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is one way they could of have one more trials and see the results. Another thing they could have done was try to stretch the plastic over a different type of texture.
3742	2	2	2	a. As shown by the data, plastic B was the plastic that stretched the most. All the other plastics were between10 - 20 while plastic B needed the with 22mm and 23mm. b. A control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment. More trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes.
3744	2	2	2	A) Based on the procedure the results were not valid. How much weight am I supposed to add. ^p B) The validity could have been improved by telling me how much weight to add or what kind of weights to use.
3745	2	1	1	From the student, I can draw the conclusion that plastic types D has the least amount of stretchability ( it did not stretch at all ). The student had a very thorough procedure but they could have improved it. They could have added more weights to the plastics to see how much weight it could have taken to stretch,as well as done more than two trials for each of the different plastics.
3746	2	3	3	A) From the data I am draw the conclusion that polymer B had the most stretchability. Polymer plastic B stretch an average of 22.5mm which was greater than polymer A, C and D. ^P B). To improve this experiment, the students should make sure that the amount of weight put on each plastic sample to make sure that the type of plastic was the only variable involved. Also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid. With more trials, the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate.
3747	2	2	2	The students conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most. For T1 it stretched 22mm and for T2 it streched 23 mm. ^p B) The students could have done more trials. They also could of hard more plastics.
3748	2	3	3	A.) Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested. Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount. ^p B.) The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length. Also must have had the same amount of weights applied.
3750	2	0	0	Each type of plastic stretched about the same or a couple millimeters off to its counterpart in the second trial. The students could have improved the design by getting and telling specific types of plastic to use and to tell us what unit of measurement to measure the unstretched and then stretched plastic.
3751	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B was the most stretchable of the plastics. The student could improve their experimental design would be to make sure all the different plastics were the same length before the weights were added, and make sure to include that original measurement in the data table. The student should also keep the number of weights on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight applied to it then another, it may appear to have stretched more.
3752	2	0	0	The students have to make sure the test results are accurate and that the answers are precise.
3753	2	3	3	a.) Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic types B has the least streghth or the most elasticity because it stretched the farthest of all the other plastics. Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity. Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth, it is the strongest or least plastic plastic. ^p b.) To improve the validity of this experiment, it would be wise to msure that each plastic is not only the same size, but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table, and is clamped at the same spot as well. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used. The same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment.
3754	2	2	2	The plastic type B had stretched the most. To improve this lab, they could of did more trials to see if their results were correct and give us what each type of plastic is and write a hypothesis based on the start of the lab to know the task at hand.
3756	2	1	1	Plastic type D has 19 better chance of having stretchability because during both trials the amount stretched out equal, so it has a accurate chance of stretching. The student could have improved this experimental design by adding another trial and reapeating the same procedure.
3757	2	2	2	Due to the data I can tell that type D streches the 2nd most but was consistent through both trials. I can also see that type A streched the least amount. Type B though, streches the most. From the data I know that type B plastic is the best because it can strech the most without breaking. This means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds. The student could have improved their experiment by saying how much weight they added, as well as be more specific in the procedure about the plastic types.
3758	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type A is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching. I would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial.
3759	2	2	2	a) The plastic B has the most amount that stretched. ^p b) The student could of improved their data's by using more tests and not the weights an for more time.
3760	2	0	0	a) According to data table the plastics had verry little change from trial to trial for an example plastic type A for trial was 10mm and trial 2 was 12 so it stretched more the second time and for B trail 1 was 22 and trial 2 was 23. for C T1 was 14 and T2 was 13 but a changed happened on plastic C the measurement stand the same for both trials with amount of 20. B) Two ways the students had did different times for each trial. Also the clamp they should have put the plastic some where else cause maybe the clamp had added more weight.
3761	2	3	3	Based on the student's data t concude that plastic type A was the strongest plastic because it streched the least amount two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design are: adding a trial 3 and recording the original length of the plastic.
3762	2	2	2	a. Based on the student's data. I can conclude that the plastic type D was the strongest polymer stretching 20mm in trial one and trial 2. I can also conclude that the plastic type A was the weakest polymer stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial B. One way the students could have done to improve their experiment is perform more trials. Another way the students could have improved their experiment is to record in the table how many weights used.
3763	2	1	1	A.) When the four different polymer plastics were tested for stretchability a second time the results changed drastically for each material as shown in the data table. ^p B.) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was by increasing the time the material have to hang, and repeat the trial a third time.
3764	2	2	2	In conclusion polymer plastic "B" is the plastic that stretched the most in this investigation. ^p The student could have added to the results the name each polymer plastic. Also, made each polymer plastic the sam length to  start with and test each one at the same time.
3765	2	1	1	a) I conclude that 12 has stretched more than 11. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is by..1) they could have added the amount of weights they used. 2) They could have timed it.
3766	2	1	1	A. It seems that seems that most of the bags stretched a little more in the second trial. ^p B. I think the student could have improved this experiment by doing more trials.
3767	2	2	2	A Conclusion I can make from this experiment is that plastic type B stretched the longest and that plastic A streatched the least. ^p B) Two ways the students can improve there experiment is by more trials and to put the plastic type in the procedure. For example this student said take a sample of one type, instead she cold have said whch one.
3768	2	3	3	I can conclude that the plastic A stratched the least from all the plastics used. And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used. Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B. The student should have done more than 2 trials. And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag. So we could know how much it was before it stratched.
3769	2	3	3	Based on the student's results, polymer B was able to stretch the furthest length being 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial two. ^p Two ways that the student could improve the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure the weight of each weight, and by performing an additional trial.
3770	2	2	2	My hypothesis of I believe that plastic type B will stretch the longest was correct. Plastic type B stretched 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. To improve this expiriment I would have included 2 more trials to make sure my expiriment was as valid as possible. I would also make sure that the temperature of the room I was in was same throughout the expiriment because a slight change in that could cause a big difference between the flexibility of the plastic at that time.
3771	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B and C stretched the most while plastics A and C stretched the least in both trials. ^p One thing the students could have done was include the length before the weights were put on it. Another thing they could have done is tell the actual weight amount & keep it constant for all plastic types.
3773	2	1	1	Two ways the student could of improved this experiment is if he would of kept adding weights and masure how low it can go until it breaks. Another way he could of improved this experiment is instead of taping it down a edge tape it down a wall so the force can go straight down. My conclusion based in the students data is the plastic type B is the most stretchable.
3774	2	0	0	When the student tested each plastic, "A" stretched 2 times more than before. "B" only stretched once more, "C" went down 1 in the second trial, but "D" stayed the same. The way the student could of improved there experiment, would be if they graph each trial for each plastic, so we could see if it increased, decreased, or stayed the same.
3775	2	2	2	A.) A conclusion I've drawn according to this table would be that plastic type A is a stronger type of plastic. ^p B.) 2 ways to improve the experiment would be to add more trials, and to have more time of the hanging weights and plastic.
3776	2	2	2	The conclusion I got for the lab is that there can't be one. We don't know the original lengths of plastic. We only have the two lengths after they were stretched. ^p 1 improvement they should make is to add the original length of the plastic . Another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic.
3777	2	2	2	Plastic type B streched the most at 45mm over the two trials, and Plastic A streched the least at 22mm. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and specify what kind of plastics they are using.
3778	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic. In trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p B) 1. The student could have had the clamps attach at the same height in each type of plastic. ^p 2. The student should have used the same amount of tape on each type of plastic.
3779	2	2	2	a) Plastic type A is shown to be the strongest while plastic type B is not. Plastic type A stretched at an average of 11mm while type B stretched an average of 22.5mm.^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by listing what weight to use and tell which type of lope to use.
3780	2	2	2	a) I can infer that plastic type B is the strongest as it stretched the most. ^p b) The student could have improved the experimental design by creating 3 trials and creating an average of the 3. Also the student should of listed the length of the plastics before and after stretching.
3781	2	3	3	a. Based on the student's data, plastic B stretches the most and plastic A is the most rigid. ^p b. The students could have improved their experimental design by using something stronger than tape to hold the plastic They also could have done more trials since their results between the two trials varied significantly.
3782	2	3	3	1) The student can conclude that plastic B stretches the most. According to the data plastic B stretched the most both trials. Twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second. While the other plastics stretched less.^p 2) The student should perform a third trial for accuracy and the student should keep a constant number of weights attached to each plastic.
3783	2	3	3	Based on the results plastic B stretched the most than D,C,A. ^p The student could of validated his statement more by giving more amounts like how much plastic and how much weight. They could also of validated it by doing the trial a 3rd or 4th time so it was more accurate.
3784	2	2	2	Plastic type A was the least stretchable. It only stretched 10-12mm. Plastic type B was the plastic with the greatest stretchability. It stretched 22-23mm. The two trials confirm this result. The students could improve their data by specifying the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same. Also, this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched, not how far they stretch. If they wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached.
3785	2	1	1	a) Based on the data plastic type B was the best best plastic to resist the weight stress. ^P b) The student must have added a control group and performed more trials.
3786	2	3	3	A) Based upon the data plastic B was the most flexable while plastic A was the least flexable. ^p B) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1. Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment. 2. Create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length.
3787	2	2	2	A conclusion that I can make based off this data is plastic type A had the biggest size difference between the two trials. One way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length. This could help determine which plastic's better. Another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp. If one plastic has more weights than the another, it will make this experiment not valid.
3788	2	2	2	My conclusion would be according to the data shown, plastic B has the highest amount being stretched. In trial one and as well as trial two. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be if they would tell us how much weights to clamp on. Also in the table include how much each weights were added on. As well as try half with weights and the other half with none.
3791	2	1	1	a) A conclusion in the student's data is that plastic type D stretches more than the other plastics do. ^p b) The student could have improved by adding on the procedure what types of plastics to use. Also the student could have added how much were the weights he used.
3792	2	2	2	From the data presented that plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. But to improve this experiment I would do more trials to make it more accurate. Also changing the environment could improve the experiment. By controlling the temperature you can find out which plastic stretches farther in a hot environment or what stretches farther in a colder environment.
3794	2	3	3	a, The conclusion is that plastic type D is more stretchable than the most stretchable plastic A. ^p I'd improve this they should have included how much weights was put into each bug and also measurement of the bag before they do the experiment.
3795	2	2	2	a. Plastic type B has the most stretching ability. As well as plastic A having the least. ^p b. 1. They could have specified which plastics they used, not just A,B,c &d.  2.  They could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps.
3796	2	1	1	Plastic B is the most ductile, followed by plastics D, C, and A, respectively. When discussing the validity of the experiment, it is best to have an average of the two trials. Also, this person did not include the initial length (unstretched) of the plastics. They should have all been cut to the same length to start with.
3797	2	1	1	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic A+B stretched more than C+D. The student could have improved the validity of this experiment by conducting more trials. With more trials it is easier to take a more accurate average. Next, the could also say the type of plastic. Instead of saying A, B, C, D their experiment would be better developed. Easier for the reader to follow. This is what can be concluded from the data, along with what could be improved throughout the experiment.
3798	2	2	2	Based on the data you can draw of conclusion of plastic type D not stretching from T1 OR T2. The plastic measured 20mm both trials.The student also could have included how much plastic is being used.The students also should have included how much many weights you hold on to the clip.
3799	2	2	2	A)In conclusion it is clear that plastic type A stretched the least over the five minutes. The plastic that was the stretchiest was plastic B.^p (B)Add a control with no weight added and a third trial.
3800	2	2	2	I conclude that polymer B had the highest rate of stretchability of 22mm for t1 and 23mm for t2. ^p The student could have added a control group and the student should have told us how much weight to add.
3802	2	3	3	a. Plastic B has the greatest ability to stretch because it stretched the most in T1 and T2. ^p b. One way to improve the experiment would be to specify how long each sample is at the beginning of each trial and have them all the same initial length ( i.e 20mm ). ^p another way to improve this experiment is to specify an exat weight to be clamped to each plastic sample ( i.e. 100 grams ).
3803	2	0	0	A) Both Trial 1 and Trial 2 are basically the same and their constant to each other their wasn't a big change.^p B) Maybe for step 4 they could add more time and get heavier weights.
3805	2	3	3	According to the student's data, plastic type B had the greatest capability of stretching because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A only stretched and average of 11 mm. One way the students could change the experiment is by cutting each plastic sample length may be a contributing factor affecting results. Another way to improve the experiment is by taping all the plastics at the same place on the table, so an equal amount of plastic is hanging of the edge.
3806	2	1	1	A-
3807	2	3	3	In total we came a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials I and II and plastic A stretch the least in trials I and II. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/ or results was by stating how many the weights were and did more trials.
3808	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic A stretched the least amount. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic D stretched the same amount of 20 mm during trial 1 and trial 2. To improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment. Another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time. Different weights can cause different results.
3810	2	0	0	(A) The polymer experiment looks it went very well. Each plastics amount that was stretched was all around the same number for both trials. Two types of plastics increased after the first trial one type of stay the same amount, and one type of plastic decreased after the first trial. ^p (B) I don't think the student needs any thing to improve this experiment.
3811	2	1	1	a) As a conclusion based on the data T2 plastic tests were more elastic than Ti. ^p B) The student could improve this by addressing how many weights were used and allow them to hang for at least two minutes more and to get new plastic tap instead of using the remaining 3.
3812	2	2	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the most in trial 1 and trial 2. The student could have added a control in these and also he could have done more trials for each separate type of plastic.
3813	2	1	1	a.Based on the data I concluded that plastic B was the best plastic in trial 1 it measured 22 mm and trial it measured 23mm meaning it was the sturdiest plastic. ^p b. The student could have measured the plastic before doing the experiment, making it a free trial, and the students could have added the weights and see how much weight it could hold before it fell to the floor instead of waiting for 5 minutes.
3814	2	0	0	(A) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B are stretchable; while plastic types C and D made no improvement. ^p (B) A way the experiment and validity could have been improved is by allowing the weights to hang longer. Another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled.
3816	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is the strechiest. ^p b) The students could have done more trials. The student could have put in the a verages to chart in order to make an easier comparison.
3817	2	1	1	a) Plastic type B and D are better to use because they stretch the stretchiest. Plastic B can stretch up to 20mm at most while plastic D can stretch up to 23 mm at most. Plastic C and plastic A can stretch the least because plastic C can stretch up to 14mm at most while plastic A can stretch up to 12 mm at most. ^p b) Two ways they would have improved the experiment is by adding more trials and telling what each plastic actually was.
3818	2	0	0	a) I can conclude that T2 did better than T1 and that plastic type B did better than A,C,D. ^p b)
3819	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the farthest over all because in the data it says it stretched 22mm and 23 mm, as where the other plastics did not stretch as far. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by having a control, and by giving an exact measurement for how much plastic you should use because if there is a larger piece, it could look as if is stretched farther than it really did.
3820	2	2	2	Plastic B has the greatest stretchability.^p The student can improve his experiment if he does more trials, uses different types of weights, increases the hang time, and uses one more plastic.
3821	2	3	3	Based on the data the B type plastic is the most stretchable. In the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. The student could improve the experiment by through, if he tells us which amount of weight he used. Also the student could try the experiment for a longer period of time and then do this experiment than twice.
3822	2	2	2	a). The students could conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable out of the four plastics because it ended up the longest in both trials, after it was stretched. ^p b. One way to improve this experiment would be to specify in step 4, how many pound of weight are being stretched. This would make sure that in each experiment it is the same amount of weight that is pulling the plastic down. Another way would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals.
3823	2	2	2	Plastic type B had the most stretchability because it stretched further than any other plastics for both trials. The student should have done another trial and have a control group.
3827	2	2	2	a: The more weights added to sample b and a, the more they stretched. Plastic C shrunk as weight was added to T1. Plastic D could have be stretched. ^p b.1. The student could give the starting lengths so there was something to compare the results to. ^p 2. The students could have mention how many weights were added, each how much weight was pulling on the plastic.
3829	2	2	2	a.) Plastic type B stretched the greatest amount and therefore held the most weight. ^p Two ways the students' could have improved their experiment are by including the much each weight weighed and the exact length of each plastic used to validate their results. A constant variable was not included.
3830	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched longer than any other plastic type. ^P b) Two ways the studen could have improved the experimental design was at given what type of plastic they used and to provide the amount of weigh they added to each clamp (grams lbs, o2, etc..)
3832	2	0	0	For both trials they had similar results. They could have improved their experiment by adding more weights instead of keeping them the same.
3833	2	2	2	In my polymer investigation, I discovered that plastic type B had streched the most in both trial with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trail 2. The plastic type to stretch the least was type A with T1 being 10mm and T2 12 mm. One way the could of improved the validity of the results is to make a average of both trials. Also another way is to say how much weight is being used to show consistency. Finally, they need a control with no weight because the clamp effects the data.
3834	2	0	0	A conclusion for this experiment could be type T2 had been the strongest for the 1st two trials and then type T1 started lasting longer and in the end they stayed the same. Still showing that type T2 was the best choice. It showed that in the end type B was the strongest. The students could have improved their experiment by naming the types of bags brand they were testing  and they also could have clamped the bag a different way for example taping it to both sides and putting weights.
3835	2	2	2	This instigation has showed that the polymer from plastic type B was the most strechable than the rest. This experiment could've been altered by adding that each weight should have been carefully placed especially towards the end. There should've been a certain amount of weights put on so that the measurement of the plastics were done fairly.
3837	2	3	3	plastic type B has the highest stretchability as it stretched 22 and 23mm, the furthest. Plastic type A is the least stretchable it only stretched 10 and 12mm, the least out of all. This experiment would be more validif the student had 3 trials instead of only 2, to rule out any problems. The student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic.
3839	2	0	0	The conclusion came out to be that the 2nd trial wasn't really that much at a difference between trial 1. Most of them was 2 or 1 difference. D stood the same.
3840	2	2	2	My conclusion is plastic type B is the most stretchy. In T1 it stretched to 22m and in T2 it stretched to 23. The least stretchy would be plastic type A. In T1 it got to 10 and in T2 it got to 12. I order of the stretchiest would be B, D, C, and A. They could have taken some time of step 4 and did one to two more trails.
3841	2	1	1	In conclusion two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to add a weight to the clamp and let them hang for more time. Also another way the student could have improved the design is to add the same weights to the plastic.
3842	2	3	3	(a) Based on the experiments, plastic type A is the strongest of all plastics, plastic B is the weakest. B is the weakest because it stretched the most and this could be because the plastic is thin, while plastic A was more thick: instead of a linear polymer like B, plastic A was probably a tratched polymer with many different bonds. ^P (b) To improve the expirement, the students should have use the same amount of each plastic to test. The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement. They should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant.
3843	2	1	1	I think plastic D is the strongest because it's the highest weight and they are both even in trial 1 and 2. ^p The first thing they can change is add a few more trials so they can really see if it stays the same or changes. Another way is to add more weight to each piece of plastics.
3844	2	2	2	Plastic B can stretch the most. They could've said the weight of the weights are used.
3845	2	0	0	B) The student could have possibly added more weight to each trial that they did to get more reasonable and noticeable results. The results shown below aren't as aromatic as you can see. Also, the student could have added more time for each time he repeated the investigation.
3847	2	0	0	The conclusion is plastic type have 10 and 12 amounts stretched. The two ways the students "Take  a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length, and add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.
3848	2	2	2	Based on the students data you can tell that plastic type ,B,was the strongest type of plastic based on the students data. Not only that plastic type ,B, was the strongest, it stretched the farthest too. Two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design is by the following ways. The student should have told, how heavy the weights were. Also the student should have told hoe much weights were needed in their experimental design.
3849	2	0	0	This data is not accurate becaus they got a different number all the time and they only got the same number once.
3850	2	3	3	Nor.
3851	2	2	2	Based on the student's results, it can be concluded that plastic type A stretched the most and has the most stretchability. However, their experiment contains many variables so this conclusion may not be necessarily true. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to make all the plastic types the same initial length, and then to record how much they stretched. This would make the experiment more valid. Secondly, they should have more than two trials to improve the validity of the results.
3852	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchiest polymer plastic because of the amount of mm it stretched in the span of five minutes. ^p b) The students needs to make each sample of plastic the exact same size and to improve the validity the could complete a third trial.
3853	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial. They could have improved the experimental design by measuring to make sure that one type of plastic isn't longer than another type. They also could have done another trial for more accurate results.
3854	2	1	1	A) Plastic B had the greatest lengths in both trials. ^p B) The students could have used more weight and they coud do the experiment over again to get better results.
3855	2	2	2	We know that plastic type b stretched the furthest. They could have said how long the plastic was when they started. They could have put the names of the types of plastics.
3857	2	1	1	A- Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible, type A is the least, and type D remained the same throughout the trials. ^P B- The studed could have improved the experimental design and validity of results by, adding heavier weights to the experiment, and extend or shorten the 5min time period.
3858	2	0	0	I don't think that's a valid answer but do to their conclusion depending on the plastic it could either increase or decrease in size.
3859	2	0	0	a) The second try has almost the same amount of stretchability the first try has. ^p B) When added weights allow them to stay for more than 5 minutes. ^p Or they could of stretched it out more wider.
3861	2	2	2	A. Based on the data plastic type B stretched the most, while plastic type A stretched the least. This tells me that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^P b. They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial. Both would help improve the accuracy of the results.
3863	2	1	1	Plastic type B is the type of plastic you want to put heavy products in because it is more durable than plastic type A which stretches only 12mm, unlike plastic type B which is 23mm. ^p One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving the amount of how much the weights weighed. Also, give the height of the table top to the floor.
3864	2	3	3	A) Based on the data, plastic B was the most strethible plastic. This is because, on average, it stretched 22.5mm in length. The next highest amount stretched, by plastic D, was an average of 20mm in length, showing that plastic B stretched the most. B) One way the student's could've improved their design is by adding a third trial. This could help make sure there was no faulty data, such as an outlier. They also could've written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics. Otherwise, for all the & prove they could've been changing these weights, which would've given them 2 independent variables, therefore, making their experiment invalid.
3865	2	3	3	One conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could have made this better /or more valid by having a third trial as well. And state how much weight is being added to the plastic.
3866	2	2	2	A.Based on the student's data plastic D is the best plastic type to use for stretchability.^p (B)Students could have improved the experimental design or validity of results is by saying the type of plastics they used. Ex: kitchen wrap, grocery bag, cooking wrap etc. They should mention/ add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap. And at last have more trials.
3867	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest on both trials and that plastic A stretched the least. The student could have improved the experimental design by naming instead of labeling the plastic type. That would have given more information and also naming the types of plastics would have given us an idea of how the polymer plastics influence its stretchability. Also, for the validity of the results the student could included time and more trials.
3868	2	0	0	a. This base on the types of bag. ^p b. We could use anothe plastic type and will try the amount of stretching.
3869	2	1	1	A) Plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm and 23 mm . Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12 mm. ^p B) The students could have improved there experimental design by saying what type of plastic it is. Another way they could've improved is by saying the repeating steps.
3870	2	2	2	Based on the the student's data, a conclusion would be that sample B is the stretchiest, also, materials  C and D have good stretchability, as long as you don't stretch it twice. One way they could improve would be that instead of measuring the substances once you take the clamp off, measure it with it on because once you take it off, it will be shortened a little. Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials.
3871	2	1	1	(a) Based on the data I can conclude that some of the plastics increase by 1 or decrease by 1. ^p (B) To improve the investigation the student should have added another trial to see how it improve.
3872	2	0	0	In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest out of all the plastic types. It stretched the most. Plastic type A was the weakest. ^p These students could have improved their experiement by writing "record your data" in the procedure after each trial. Also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way.
3873	2	2	2	A conclusion I've made based on the students data is all of the plastics increased the stretch except for plastic type C that decreased. I also saw that plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental designs was by adding more trials and by using different kind of weights.
3875	2	2	2	According to the results, polymer "A" is the strongest. It could hold the most weight, without stretching. The more a polymer streched, the closer it was to breaking, so that is why "A" was the strongest. The student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results is to insure that they are using the name type of polymer for each one and that they are adding the same amount of weight to each polymer. That will improve the results.
3877	2	0	0	b) 1. Perform the second trial different than the first. ^p     2. Repeat with fresh plastic. ^p     3. Add more than one types of plastic.
3878	2	3	3	It can be concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest of the 4 plastics, and that plastic type A is the least stretchiest. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was by doing more trials to data in more results, and by specifying the exact mass of the weights hanging from the plastic.
3879	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least. They could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were. They could have said how much weren't they used. They finally could have said what the starting length should be.
3881	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B was streched the most in trial one and in trial two. To improve this experiment about polythers plastics for stretchability would be to use a different way to show the data. For example a graph chart. Another way to improve this experiment would be to record the length of the plastic without having it stretched.
3882	2	3	3	a.) The student's data shows that the type B plastic is the most stretchy while type A plastic is the least stretchy. Type C is almost the same firmness as A, and D has almost the same stretch as B. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by stating the weight of the weights they used, to make sure they used the same weight for each plastic type. They could have repeated the experiment more, to validate their results.
3883	2	1	1	A) In conclusion, each A,B,C and D had different results. A and C stretched more. Both trial 1 and 2 had different answers accept plastic type D it reamred the same. ^p B) To improve this experiment students could of made more trials for more accurate answers. Also, repeat the steps.
3884	2	0	0	They added up around each other, meaning the stretched all almost the same all plastic it was the same both trials. ^p They could put range info on the data table and they could of describe the procedure better.
3885	2	1	1	From the data I concluded that type D plastic type holds its plastic under weight staying at 20mm, and type A plastic type was the worse dropping 2mm. They should've test the bags wit a variety of weight. Also I would've done one more trial to see if the numbers stayed constant.
3886	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most compared to plastic type A, C, and D. Therefore, B has the most stretchability. Two ways to improve the experimental design are to make sure each plastic starts at the same length and that the same amount of weights are used for each plastic.
3887	2	3	3	A conclusion I have drawn is that plastic type B is the best plastic in this experiment. I know this because the data shows that it had stretched the most compared to the other three plastics in five minutes. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the result would be in perform the experiment again and make sure the same weights are used. By performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of two and for once accurate. By using the same weights, we would know that the plastics are stretched fully.
3888	2	3	3	A.Plastic B stretched the most, D the second most, C the second least and A the least.^p B. for one student cased have included more trials only two trials is not that many and could have found and take results. More trials would have increased the validity. For another, the inident have specified the weight of the "weight"in the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled, therefore therefore specifying the weight of the weight would have been highly been held to both the experimental to design and the validity.
3889	2	2	2	Based on the data plastics type A stretched the least. Followed by B,D,C. Plastic A stretched the most with two mm. One way they could improve it is to test it more times. They could also have mentioned the weight of the weights he used to stretch the plastic.
3891	2	1	1	B, tell wat the a weightt of weights were.
3892	2	2	2	That plastic A was more durable than plastic B.^p For one he/ she could been more specific with the plastic type and the amount of weight needed to be used.
3893	2	2	2	The conclusion that I have draw from this data is that two plastic did stretch while one stay the same and on other seemed to shrink. Two ways that this student could have improved the experiment is by having what type of plastics that is going to be tested all the same length before the hanging them of the table and the amount of weight including there mass to improve the validity of this experiment and it results.
3894	2	2	2	a. The conclusion is that plastic type d is the material that has stretched the most plastic types A stretched the least. One way that the student could have improved would be by adding a timer into the procedure. Also to have the same weights of each plastic.
3895	2	3	3	a) From this data, one can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. The data supports that this polymer plastic has the most specified what length the four plastics should all start at. In order to increase the validity of the experiment. They could also have specified what amount of weight so that each plastic would be pulled by on equal amount.
3896	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other four. The student could have done more trials. They could of also tell us a specific weight.
3898	2	2	2	The student's data revialed that plastic A could be most restitence to stretching. One way the students could have improve this experiment is add more trials. Another way is add control to the experiment.
3899	2	0	0	A:) If you hang weights on plastic type B then it will stretch at least 2-3 inchs. ^p B:) They could of told of what type of plastics they used and which one was the control.
3900	2	2	2	By the data given in the table plastic type A was the most stretchable while plastic D was the strongest and didn't stretch at all. The student could've improved the experiment by stating how much was the weight applied on the plastic, also they could've used a better way to stick the plastic on the table.
3902	2	2	2	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most, while type A was the least stretchable. ^p b) 2 ways the student could have improved are, one, tell what the length of each plastic was to begin with, and make sure they are all the same length, and also different lengths of time could have been tested, like 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes.
3903	2	3	3	A) From the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type B has the most stretchability, stretching an average 22.5mm per trial, compared to type D's 20mm, type C's 13.5mm and type A's 11mm. ^p B) One way the student could have improved is by increasing the number of trials carried out which will increase data accuracy and lessen the effect of outlians. A second way he could've improved is by stating the weight of the weights he used. Not specifying this could lead to variations of data, and almost impossibility to replicate the experiment.
3904	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B was the stretchiest, and plastic type A was least stretchiest. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are; one, do a third trial for each plastic: and two, test a control which will not stretch.
3905	2	0	0	a) based on the data T'd like to include that plastic D had streched the longest of all. I can also see that all the plastics streched except for plastic C... it was the only plastic that got shorter rather than strech. ^P b) I think that the only improvement that this experiment needed was to possibly increase the tim 5more minutes before sarting the next trial. Validity on the experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials.
3906	2	2	2	A) The conclusion isthat, plastic type B has more stretchability than the others. ^p B) Two way the student could have improved the experiment was that they should have repeat the experiment multiple times to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be streched.
3907	2	1	1	Based on student data, I noticed that the trial two (T2) plastics stretched longer then most plastics in trial one (T1). I believe the students could have made the time period that they were stretched for longer. I believe some plastics could have stretched more. Also, I think that in their procedure, they should have discussed the amount of weights they put on the clamp for future reference.
3908	2	2	2	A) That for the first trial plastic type B stretched more for the second trial plastic type B stretched 1 more mm and it ended up the most plastic that has stretched.^p b) The two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by having more trials and by using the types of plastics that they were using.
3909	2	0	0	A conclusion I can make is that all the plastic types and trials were all about the same thing.^p Hang, the clamps for more than 5 minutes, attach clamp to top edge.
3910	2	3	3	Based on the data provided by the studence, I have concluded that plastic type B streched the most in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p One way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by having a continuat for example they could have done a third trial  to see if there was anymore change. The second way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by giving the length of each plastic to see if they were the same.
3911	2	2	2	A conclusion I draw from the data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic of them all. The data supports this answer cause on average it stretched 2.5mm farther than the others and 11.3mm farther then plastic "A" two ways students could have improved results of to include more trials cause its hard to get a good average of two trials. Also I would try adding more trials with different weights, because maybe are plastic is the stretchable when at lower weight.
3912	2	0	0	The two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
3913	2	2	2	A) From the experiment the students performed we can conclude that plastic type A stretched the most as compared to plastics type B,C,D because from "T2" it started at 10 and to T2 it went to 12. Whereas for the others it stretched only 1mm and in type "A it stretched 2mm". ^p B0 The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials so they could get better and more precise results. They could also be more specific about the weights and tell us what to start with, small weights and then gradually get to heavier ones or use all the same.
3914	2	0	0	I dont think his stretchability investigation work. I feel that the student didnt has to exactly respect everything 3 times and they didnt have add weights to clamp and allow them hang.
3916	2	2	2	a) In conclusion plastic B stretched the longest while plastic A stretched the least. ^p B) The student could of told us what type of plastic to use in the procedure. The student could of also tried more trials to see if the stretched plastic changed sizes.
3917	2	2	2	Based on the results, plastic type A stretched the least and plastic type B stretched the most, therefore the order for the stretchiest plastic/polymers is B, D, C, then A. The student could have used the same weight on each of the polymer. The student could have spesified how much time to allow the weight to pull on the plastics.
3918	2	0	0	Based on the data. I can see that most of the plastic wraps either stayed the same or increased on the length stretched out. I can say the weights did have an impact on how long it stretched out to be overall, it was a good experiment w/ information, but there could've been improvements. Next time I would recommend trying different weights to see if the amount of weight will determined the length. Also, we can add more time to how long the weights stays on the plastic.
3919	2	2	2	I conclude from this lab that plastic type "B" stretched the most out of all of the polymers. This means it has more elasticity than the others. I also conclude that plastic type "A" stretched the least out of all of the polymers. This means it has less elasticity than the other types of polymers. ^p One way the student could improve the lab is to add more trials. That would make the hypothesis more true. Another way is by deleting human mistake, by meaning correctly and things like that.
3920	2	2	2	A) After testing and collecting data I compared each result and I it either stretched by 2 to 1 mm each test sometimes it don't move.^p A. By doing more trials and by having the same amount of weight in each one.
3921	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability. The data shows that in both trials (T1 and T2), plastic B stretched 22 and 23. ^p b) The students could have done another trial to make their data more valid they also could have let the weights hang more than five minutes.
3922	2	3	3	The results from the students polymer lab show that plastic type B stretched furthest in both that's then any other material. The students could have improved the experiment by telling how much weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them, I.F. shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp. As always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab.
3923	2	2	2	A good conclusion I can make from the data is type A and C were the most alike and types B and D were the most alike. For example for T1 type A had 10 and type C had 14 and for T2 type B had 22 and type D had 20. The student could have improved the experimental design by telling the reader how much plastic should be hanging down the table and also he should have been told how heavy the weights were.
3924	2	1	1	Based on the student's data the conclusion I have drawn up is that plastic B was the most stretchy in both trial 1 and trial 2. Plastic B streched the most out of all the plastics. Two ways this student could have improved the expirimental design was to have a constant, and to add that there are four different types of plastics not just one.
3925	2	2	2	a. The conclusion would be that plastic B had the most stretchability while plastic a had the least. ^p b. Two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials. Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials. Another would be to make the procedure more understandable. And they should keep the weights on for longer, this will give more extensive and accurate data.
3926	2	0	0	Based on the data that has been recorded it lists that the second trial that they did with the bags was the trial where the bags were able to hold on to the weights and stretch out the most. A way that the students could of have improved their experiment would've been to add more weights and see at how much they would of ripped instead of waiting 5 minutes.
3927	2	2	2	a) I came to the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability out of all plastics. Plastic B was stretched to an average of 33. ^p b) The student could have improved his experimental design by conducting a third trial and telling the readers what plastics were involve]d in the experiment.
3928	2	2	2	The students found that the weakest polymer is B and the strongest is A on the first trial,B stretched 22 mm and on the second trial, it stretched 23mm , However, A was the strongest because on the first that , it stretched 10 mm  and on the second  trial. it stretched 12mm without breaking. The students could have improved their  exprement by being more specific about the different polmers used, they could apply the weights onto the plastic instead of the clamps to see how much it dents the plastic, and they should do more trials.
3931	2	1	1	Based on the data documented in the table I can conclude that over that plastic type D has the most elasticity because on both trials it stretched to 20mm.Two ways that the student could have improved the design or validity could have been to: specify the amount of the weights being used and specify on what types of plastic to use.This would make the validity higher.
3933	2	0	0	a) Plastic A was 10mm long & then it reached out to 12mm plastic B was 22mm & then went to 23mm, plastic C was 14mm & then went to 13mm & plastic D was 20mm & than stayed the same. B) One way this student could have improved was to give us the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details. I say the validity is not right because if I want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then I would have gotten something different.
3935	2	2	2	In conclusion, our hypothesis was widing because plastic type B stretched the most instead of plastic type C. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the results are they could have included how much weight they put on the clamps and also they could have left the weights on far mo0re than 5 minutes.
3936	2	3	3	Based on the students data, the plastic type B was the plastic with the most stretchability. The group could have improved their design by specifying how much weight weighed and kept it constant by having each weight the same. Also, they should have included before and after length in their design table.
3937	2	2	2	(a) Plastic B has most cross-linking because it is the strongest and stretched furthest. ^p (b) The student should have increments in which the weights are added, and how much of the plastic should be hanging off the side. Each plastic should be the same length.
3938	2	1	1	A) Based on the data shown in the table. One strongest type of was plastic B. But plastic D had a costant amount of stretch. ^p B) One way the student could have improved the experimental design was by including how much weight to add. Also to compare the results with any other student who performed his same experiment.
3939	2	0	0	b. The students could have improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs. They could have also improved there expriment by solving the resolts by adding or subtracting.
3940	2	2	2	a) With the given data, plastic type B has the most stretchability due to its stretches of 22mm and 23mm. None of the other plastic types stretched as much, Plastic D one the closest at 20mm. b) The student could have improved the validity of the experiment by eliminating a large variable created, which has the length of each sample at a constant length. Also, he could have measured the lengths are smaller amounts such as every minute, not every 5 minutes.
3941	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the 'stretchiest' plastic. ^p (b) Make all original lengths equal I add the same weights (undefined in the procedure). Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic.
3942	2	0	0	A) My conclusion is that the expirement was very un organized and not well thought - out. ^p B)These student could have improved their expiremental design by one, telling us the materials they used like what kind of plastic objects they used like whether or not they were strechable. Just to give us more of a second thought about how theyre data came out. they could have organized their data alot better.
3943	2	2	2	I conclude that after seeing the data that plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all the plastics. I say this because in trial 1, it stretched 22mm and trial 2 it stretched 23mm. The plastic that stretched the closist to that was type D, which stretched to 20mm both times. Two ways that they could have improved in labs validity is one, adding a third trial to each plastics. And two, taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type.
3944	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the farthest in both trials while plastic type A stretched the least meaning type B was more stretchability than type A. ^p b. One way the student could've improved this experiment would be to add a control group so you could see the initial lengths of the plastics. Another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability.
3946	2	0	0	A) Based on the data table plastic type A had the most amount stretched so it is the stretches. ^p B) One thing they could have done was add weight and see which one would rip faster another thing they could of done was add more time.
3947	2	3	3	a. I conclude that plastic B is the strongest with an average stretch length of 22.5 mm. Plastic A is the least stretchiest with an average of 11 mm. Plastic D is the second stretchiest with an average of 20 mm, and plastic C is the third with 13.5 mm as the average. ^p b. 1) They could have had a constant beginning plastic length. ^p 2) They could have had a standard weight of the weight and tried stretching with heavier or lighter weight for a 3rd trial to see how the weight affects the polymer.
3948	2	3	3	Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. To improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to add so it is the same for all test+ should make a specific length for the plastic.
3949	2	0	0	In conclusion T2 was mostly longer than T1 because T2 had more higher measure than T1. One way this student could of improve is he could of put heaver weights. Another was he could of done it was he kept reducing the tape size.
3950	2	3	3	Based on the students data plastic B stretched the most with 22 mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for trial 2. These students could have improved in a lot of things. First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design. They could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was. They could have also added more trials to get a better result.
3951	2	3	3	Conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type B. Improvements they could of had more than one two trials and they could have added the original lengths of the plastic in their results. To know that all the plastics were the same length.
3952	2	1	1	The conclusion that B is the strechiest and A is the least. Two way's the student could have made his experiment better was test the dip is the plastics and the width.
3953	2	2	2	Based on the data, we descovered that plastic type B stretched the most after 5minutes of the weights on it with a total of 23mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design was to add x amount more weight to the plastic to see how much it stretched the other way would be to have one or two more trials to eliminate any chance of errors.
3954	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. Plastic type A was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for T2 and 12mm for T2. ^p (b) One way to improve the experiment would have been to add a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic starting length, weights added, and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials.
3955	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable with an average  of 22.5mm of stretchability. The least most stretchable had an average stretchability of 2.5mm less than type B of 20mm. ^p b) the student could have specified a single starting length for each trial of each type of plastic. ^p The student could have specified the weight to add.
3956	2	1	1	Well fro 1 they could have named the plastics. The second way is to name why they are doing it,and finally they could have measure it was before they started testing.
3957	2	0	0	(T2) Had stretched more than trial (T1) for plastic type A, B. Then (is was lower than T1 then plastic type D was exactly the sam.
3959	2	1	1	A) Plastic type A stretched the most, (2mm) and type D did not.stretch at all. ^P B) All plastics started at the same length. Make sure the temperature is the same.
3960	2	1	1	Polymer type C was the strongest plastic with only a difference or 1mm in two trials. This student could've listed the starting length of the plastic.
3961	2	3	3	According to the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. Plastic D was the second most flexible because it stretched an average of 20mm, while plastic C was the third most flexible plastic because it stretched an average of 13.5mm. Lastly, plastic A stretched the least with an average of 11mm. However, these results are not valid. In order to make them valid, the students would need to use plastics that are the same length; and use the same weight to stretch. This would ensure valid results, because it would be guaranteed the same size plastic was being pulled with the same forces.
3963	2	2	2	3. a) Plastic type B stretched out the most between the two trials with plastic type D coming on close. ^p b. The students could've made a third trial to be more valid & or allow the weights to hang more than 5 min instead, it could've been 10 min.
3964	2	1	1	a) According to this investigation, the shorter the plastic is the more it will stretch. ^p The experiment is not very valid due to the following: we are not aware of what each plastic type is. Also more trials should have been done so you could have more of a comparison between each trial. Two trials is not enough.
3965	2	0	0	Two ways could have been improved is by doing group and they needed a hypothesis to know wether their question was right or wrong s conclusion is the plastic type A and D there used because they might have putten more weights on different types for the second trial.
3966	2	2	2	A conclusion about this students data is plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved the design or validity of results is they should have said if the weights had to be the same mass. They could have also told the type of tape to use because some tapes hold up more heavier things than other types do.
3967	2	1	1	3. a) Plastic A and C have very similar inatups based on the amount they stretched, and likewise with plastic B and D. ^p b) The entire procedure is vague and contains no actual numbers. One way they could have improved would be if, they specified the amount of weight they used to get this results they got; And the way , just to help the people trying to reperform this experiment this experiment would, would be to specify which platics are done at which time.
3968	2	2	2	In conclusion to plastic that had the most stretchability was plastic A. It is the most flexible because the changed the most from trial 1to trial 2. It changed by 2mm. The student could have improved on there experiment by adding more trials to. Increase validity and compare the plastic from before the weights were put on. We don't know the length of the plastic at first or how much weight they used.
3969	2	2	2	a) Plastic B-D on the second trial had the most stretch, than the other plastic A-C. ^p b) By doing it 3 times instead of 2.(trial) and showing the difference for example B on the the second trial stretched more than D by 3.
3970	2	2	2	a) A conclusion that I can draw from the students data is that plastic type B stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved their experimental design is one, they should have stated what four types of plastic they were using. Secondly, they should have said the amount of weights they put on the clamp.
3971	2	2	2	A. In conclusion plastic B was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial. ^p B. Could have had 3 trials. Also could have under control.
3972	2	2	2	a. Plastic Type  B stretched the most and plastic Type A stretched the least. ^p b.) The student could have tested each type of plastic for several different times. He also could have done more trials with each type of plastic.
3973	2	3	3	According to the results shown on the table I can conclude that the plastic type B is the most stretchable. Type B stretched the most at 23 mm. Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm. Type A only stretched 12 mm. There are many ways that the group could have improved their design. One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic. Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps. This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results.
3974	2	1	1	a) Plastic B was definitely the most stretchy and of all the plastics. ^p B) He could have recorded how much the plastic stretched at certain intervals of time, maybe every minute. he also could have tested both plastics each to back. The same way twice in 3 trials.
3975	2	1	1	a: Plastic type B had the most stretchability. ^p To improve the valedity of the results the students could have measured the plastic 2 times on each trial.
3976	2	2	2	As the type of plastic changed from type A all the way to type D, the amount of stretch increased from 10mm to 23mm. ^p They could increase the amount of trials and make all plastics starting length the same.
3977	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, plastic type B was stretched the farthest for both trials, and plastic type A had the least amount of stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials and tell us the specific amount of weight used for each plastic.
3978	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type D has the most sretchability. To validate the results, the students could have done a third trial and averaged the three lengths for each plastic. They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane.
3979	2	0	0	Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results, the first would be to figure out what kind of plastic and then write it down on the date table. The second way would be to write down the average of the T1 and T2. A conclusion based on the student's data is which plastic stretched the most.
3980	2	3	3	a. Overall plastic type b had the most stretchability amongst all of them.^p b.1  done more trials to compare with results. b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct.
3984	2	1	1	a) Plastic type a had the highest stretchability, while plastic type D had the lowest stretchability. ^P b) 1. Say the exact measure of the plastic sample (in step 1) to make them all the same so that the starting mm of the plastic would be a constant. ^P 2. Have a control group, one piece of plastic that did not have a clump on the bottom edge.
3985	2	2	2	The conclusion would be that type B plastic streched the most for both trial one and two. Type D made no change, it streched the same amount for both trials. One way they could have fix their experiment was record what the length of the plastic was before the strech and the change of it. Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were.
3986	2	2	2	(A) Plastic type B shows the most stretchability because T2 it stretched 22 and T2 it stretched 23. Plastic type D stretched 20mm in T1and T2. Plastic type C went from 14mm in T1 to 13mm in T2. Lastly, plastic A went from 11mm in T1 to 10mm in T2. This shows that plastic B is the most stretchable. ^p (B) The students could have shown the initial weigh of the materials and should have had the material on start of the same length.
3987	2	2	2	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experiment is by doing 3 or 4 trials instead of 2. Also, by letting the plastics hang for 5 minutes, but also 10 minutes.
3988	2	0	0	From the data of this lab, I can infer that in the second trial plastic types A and B both stretched farther than they did in the first trial. And type C didn't stretch as much as if did in the first trial, and type D stretched evenly with what it stretched the first trial. Two ways they could have made this procedure better is by doing the experiment on the same surface, and by having the same person conducting the experiment in both trials.
3989	2	2	2	The polymer that has the most stretchability was plastic type B with 22 mm for the first trail and 23 for the second. Plastic type A had10 and 12, type C had 14 and 13, type D had 20 and 20. One way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails.
3990	2	1	1	Overall, plastic type a stretched the most. Therefore, it must be weaker than the others. One way this experiment could be improved is saying repeat experiment for plastics B, C, and D. They did not mention other plastics. Another way their experiment could be improved is that the students could add another trial to prove their results correct.
3993	2	0	0	Based on the student's data, plastic tube ''D'' stretched the most, for T1 and T2 both trys was the same number 20. Plast type A for T1 and T2 has the lowst stretch amount.
3994	2	1	1	A) Mt conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B had the more affect for its stretchability. Plastic A had the least stretchability when it comes to the weights of clamps on top of the bag. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by including what types of plastic and how long do we leave the weights on top of plastic.
3996	2	1	1	They could of repeat all the steps over.
3997	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is plastic type B is more stretchable than the others because in T1 it stretched 22mm and T2 it stretched 23. The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic B. Two ways the students could've improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is did a third trial, and measure how far the plastic was on the edge of the table.
3998	2	3	3	A. In conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type B at 22 and 23mm. The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm. ^p B. One way to improve this experiment is to add constants like, how many weights and how much do they weigh. Also they should do another trial and then average out the results.
3999	2	2	2	a) In Conclusion, plastic type B is a better polymer plastic for stretchability: due to the fact that the first trial is stretched 22mm and the second trial it stretched 23mm. The polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A. The first trial is stretched 10mm and the second trail it stretched 12mm.^p b) One way they could have improved this experimental design would be, by adding a certain ammount of weight. And another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control.
4000	2	3	3	Based on the student results, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable. In the data, plastic type B stretched to 22 mm on T1, and 23mm in T2. None of the other plastics had stretched as much. Then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data. Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics.
4001	2	2	2	a) A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. b) 2 ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much weight to put on the clamps and the types of plastics used.
4002	2	2	2	a) Plastic type A, stretches longer than all other types, in other words it has more stretchability. Types B+C have the same stretchability, and D has the least stretchability, had the least durability, kepping it's structure while the others did not. ^p b)1) Made all the types start out in the same length. 2) specified the amount of weight that was applied, 3) Recorded the length of the sample before stretching it.
4003	2	2	2	Based on the students data some of the plastic stretched, some stayed the same and one of them even got smaller. One way they could have improved there experiment is have the plastic all the same size. Another way they could improve this is by saying how much weight they put on and keep the weight the same for all.
4004	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type A is the least stretchable, while plastic type B is the most stretchable. Plastic types B and C fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; B was more stretchable than C. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experiment would be cutting all of the samples to uniform lengths and widths, rather than simply measuring what their length already was. The student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample.
4005	2	1	1	a) Plastic type D seems to be more accurate of stretchability because after both trials T1 and T2 the amount stretched is the same at 20 mm. ^P b) One the experiment could be proved is to repeat the experiment. A second way is to make an hypothesis before starting the experiment.
4006	2	1	1	A=is not much of diference of T1 to T2 is only 1 or 2 mm so is really acuret. B= they shouded have more plastic type and more trials.
4007	2	2	2	a. A conclusion that can be made is that they used plastic B, then plastic B will stretch the most.^p b.More trials and use more plastic types.
4008	2	2	2	The conclusion I draw to this investigation is plastic type B as the most stretchability compared to all the others and plastic A as the least stretchability. ^p Two ways the student could've improved this experiment would be a clearing with the for example how much weight and also mention what type of materials needed to conduct this experiment.
4009	2	2	2	Well as we see on
4010	2	0	0	The conclusion it draws from this is that they.
4011	2	1	1	Plastic type B was the stretchiest plastic type. It listatcched a total of 45 mm plastic type D was second it stretched  a total of 40 mm plastic C was the 3rd stretchiest it stretched a total of 27 mm and plastic A was the least stretched it stretched a total of 22 mm.
4013	2	3	3	A) A conclusion I can draw by looking at the student's data is that the type B plastic stretched the most after the two trials. ^P B) The two ways these student could have improved their was by added more trial. Also they should have established a starting length of the plastic.
4015	2	2	2	a)Plastic type B stretched most, D second most, C third most, and A stretched the least making B the most stretchable and A the least. b) One way to improve the experimental design and/or validity is to tell which types of plastics they used another is to tell how much weight they added in the clamp.
4016	2	2	2	Plastic type B was the weakest and stretches the most, a way to improve the experiment would be to designate what each type of plastic is and how much weight to use on the clamp.
4017	2	2	2	A) After reviewing the data I have figured out that plastic type B for both trials 1,2 the plastic stretched the longest. Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm, plastic type B is the least change. B) 2 ways they could of improved there experiment is do a control with all plastic types with the same weight for all of them. Also they could of hangeach plastic for different lengths of time do 2 trials one of 5mins 1 of 10.
4019	2	2	2	a) Based on the data show plastic type B was the stretchiest material and plastic type a is the least. b) In there data table they could have given how much weight was appiyed the the material. In the procedure the students could have been more specific on the unite used and elaborated more on performing the procedure to make it easier for the next person to use it and under stand.
4020	2	1	1	A) On the trial A,B,C and D stretched quiet long and plastic B is the most longest so plastic B is the best from all. On the second trial, the result is not a lot difference from the first trial, plastic A,B and C stretched 1.2 mm more and plastic D still the same. B) Students should put the original measurement for all the plastics and put in the data table. The students should leave the weights on the clamp to hang there longer than 5 minutes to see if those plastics could stretched even more.
4021	2	0	0	The students sould had said what type of plastic they used and if they were the same, and say what was the main reason for us to no how much a the plastic streched.
4022	2	3	3	(a) A conclusion that could be drawn based on the students data is that plastic type B can stretch the most with T1 being 22mm and T2 being 23. And plastic type A stretching the shortest with T1 at 10mm and T2 at 23mm. ^p (b) The student should have made sure that all plastics strips are the same length and the student should have tape all the stips in the same spot.
4023	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest out of plastic A, C, and D. On the first try streching 22mm and the second time streching 23mm. To make the experiment better the student should have done the experiment a couple more times because plastic type D streched 20mm both times. The second way he or she could make it better is by telling how much weight he added on the clamp.
4024	2	3	3	a.) According to the student's results, type B plastic was longer in length and stretchable. Plastic A seemed to be the least stretchable butonly at a length of 10-12 mm. ^p b.) The student could have been to say how much weight to put in the clamp so it could be a constant variable. Also, the student could have put the initial length of the plastic with the results to see which plastic had stretched the most.
4025	2	1	1	a. After time the maximum stretch of a palmer goes down and becomes stronger. ^p b. He could of made the laties longer of tell how much waits you were adding.
4026	2	3	3	A. Based on the finding the stretchiest plastic is type B, stretching 22mm in T1 and 12mm in T2. The least stretchy would be type A, stretching 10mm in T1 and 12 in T2. ^p B. 1. They needed to specify the size of the plastic samples ( for example 3in*5in). If they weren't all the same size the results would be inaccurate. 2. They also needed to specify the weight without it, one sample could stretch more having 10 pounds on it, than on sample with only 2 porkets on it.
4027	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B had stretched the farthest. The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis. A way this student could have improved this was by telling us how what the original measurement the plastic type was. Therefore we could see how much it's stretched. I think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid.
4028	2	1	1	a) I conclude that the it plastics tested showed some increased in length when stretched.I believe that the plastics way that they were stretched increased in length over to me that what I found in this experiment.^p b) I believe they should have identify the different plastics.I also believe that they should of said how much weight the plastic was holding and many. That what should of been added.
4029	2	2	2	With the data recorded. I know that plastic type B is the most it stretchable of the  four plastics type I tested. ^p It would of been wise to state what the plastics were for and how much the weight's weighed.
4030	2	0	0	The student is conclusion is A student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability and the two ways the student could is the student not talk procedure polymer and attach a clean to the bottom edge on the plastic sample.
4031	2	0	0	In conclusion in the 1st trial all of the plastics here higher. In the second trial plastic A increased by 2mm, plastic B increased by 1mm, plastic C increased by 1mm, and plastic D stayed the same. I believe the amount of plastic stretched in the second trial depends on the type of plastic.
4033	2	0	0	In the second trial, the length for plastic A and B went up. For plastic C the longer length was 14 in the first trail. But in plastic D, the amount stretched stood exactly the same. Two ways the student could have improve this experimental design is drawing a line graph and give the data table a little more details.
4034	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data I've concluded that plastic B was the stretched plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the design by adding a control group, and adding more trials.
4037	2	2	2	Overall plastic A is the most durable. Plastic B was the weakest in both tests. They could have improved their experiment by having there trials for more data. They could have added more weight in the second trial.
4039	2	2	2	The amount that plastic type A stretched was 10mm on the first trial and 12mm on the second trial. Plastic type B stretched 22mm, then 23mm the second time. Plastic type C stretched 14mm first and 13mm second. Plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. To improve this lab they could have made one more trial & averaged the 3 results. They could also specify on the weights they were using to make the results more interesting.
4040	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A stretched the least. It is the strongest of the four, because it only stretched an average of 11mm (averaged from the two trials), while B's average stretch was 22.5mm C's average stretch was 13.5, and C's average was 20mm. (b). They should have specified the amount of weight. They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic.
4041	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22-23 mm, and plastic type A stretched the least with 10-12 mm. ^p b. Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by having all of the plastics being the same length in the beginning and adding a certain amount of weights not just saying ''add weights''.
4042	2	0	0	The student could of improved their experiment by leting it stretched a little longer or add another clamp to the plastic sample.
4043	2	2	2	A) I can conclude that this experiment was not valid. This student only had two trials instead of three. ^p B) This prolect could have been valid if the student had three trials and if they had kept their controlled group constant.
4044	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A streached the least because it streached an average of 11mm. Plastic type C and D are in the midle. ^P b) Add weights to the clamp before they put it on the plastic. Specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic.
4045	2	1	1	(A) A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type A produced the most amount of stretching from trial 1 to trial 2 (10mm to 12mm) compared to all the other plastic types. However, plastic type D remain the same and on one of the plastuc types C, the amount it stretched decrease from 14 to 13. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the result are instead of using one type of plastic, they should have used various types to broad the results. Also the student could have done more trials.
4047	2	0	0	Plastic type A was the only type of plastic that stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment design by having two measuring devices. Also, they could of used heavier weights.
4048	2	1	1	The students could have impared the experiment by doing the amount many times to check if it was accurate.
4050	2	2	2	Polymer B is the most stretchable plastic. ^p The improve the experiment, the student could have massed the weight used in step 4 to use the same amount of weight to the plastics in the second trial than the first trial.
4052	2	1	1	a) According to my results plastic type B had the greatest amount stretched with 22mm in trial one and in trial 2 with 23mm. I would rely on plastic type B to hold my things. ^p B) 1-st way the student's could have made theire results validity better one instead of putting plastic type A B C D they should have labeled them by what plastic they were. 2-nd the students should have seen how far the plastic could stretch before breaking.
4053	2	3	3	a) In conclusion plastic type B had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two. Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials. ^p b) The students could have added how many weights they put on the plastic, and how much each weight weighed. They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched.
4054	2	3	3	Conclusively  plastic type B tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples. ^P 1. There is no control in the starting length of the plastics. Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results. ^P 2. The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant. Plastic type B, which stretched the longest, could have had more weight on it than the others.
4055	2	3	3	A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. A student could improve the design and results by adding more trials, and specifying how much weight should be added. These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design.
4056	2	0	0	a) Based on the data plastic A-C shows a decrease of 1 or 2 (mm) of stretch. Plastic ''D'' is a reasonable plastic to be used as stretchability. ^p There's no need for improvement for the experiment design or results.
4057	2	1	1	Based on the students data plastic type A and B in trial 2 did better than trial 1, but C, D of trial did better than trial 2. One way the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to measure how can the table was that the weigh were hanging off the plastic with. Another way the could've done better was to test the trial again to see more results.
4058	2	0	0	b) We need material they are plastic, tape clamp it shows that it was the lab of polymer plastics.^p Hypothesis if we attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample then1 weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes and remove the weight measure the length of the plastic because repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastics.
4060	2	1	1	a.) After testing this experiment, the results show that plastic sample D stretched the most (mm), making it the weakest plastic. Plastic type A appeared to have streched the least amount of mm, making it the strongest plastic. b) The students could have made this experiment more valid by adding a controlled group. They could have also done a trial in order to increase the validity of their experiment.
4061	2	3	3	a) We can conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable from all the types, but the lab is not valid because judging by the results the lab was not done the same for each trial.^p b. Two way to improve this lab are: Have s or third trials at least, state the weight of the product used to put on the plastic materia.
4062	2	2	2	a. One conclusion I have fro this data was that plastic "D" was the weakest and stretched the most. ^P b. One way they could have improved this expirement is to make sure all sample sizes are the same length, and making a change if they arent. Another way is by specifiying how much weight to add to the clamp at the bottom of the ample.
4063	2	0	0	3. The second trial(12) is not exactly the same as the first trial(11) cause in the second trial even 1 type plastic goes up but on stays the same. They could of improved the experiment design by make sure every thing is in order, make sure to every type of plastic samples you do the same to it.
4064	2	2	2	A) I have concluded that based on the students data that plastic type stretched the most amount of millimeters and plastic type A stretched the least amount of millimeters. ^P B) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are that a control should have been added to that experimental off at and include how much weight was added to the clamp.
4065	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretchable most 22mm in T1 & 23mm in T2. Plastic A stretched the least at only 10mm T1 and 12 mm T2. This experiment isn't exactly valid however because stretching the material 2 times usually makes it stretchier the second trial. Hence, the mm stretched in T2 was usually greater for all 4 plastics. Instead, you should have 2 of each plastic to onsure validity. Also, they could have had a trial 3 to see the results came at the same.

5204	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia depend on mostly one type of food source. Pandas eat nothing but bamboo & the koalas mostly eat eucalyptus leaves. Therefore if they were to be placed somewhere else, in another area it would be hard for them to survive. Pythons on the other hand that are moved from their native area will try and consume any animal to survive, like the python in Everglades region that was found swallowing an alligator.
5205	3	1	1	The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they both have both exclusive diets. Meaning they only eat things like bamboo or eucalyptus leaves. Those animals differ from the python because the python can adapt its diet to wherever it is living.
5206	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist animals. In the article it stated that pandas only eat bamboo, like koalas can only eat eucalyptus leaves.

5224	3	2	2	In the article it says that China's panda, "eat almost nothing but bamboo" and Australia's koala bear "eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively." They are similar because they both only eat a very small range of foods, they are specialists. The pythons is a generalist. It is different because it eats a huge range of animals, basically whatever is there and only needs the right climate, not the same food everywhere.

The conditions and food a python requires is much more compared to koalas/ pandas.
5238	3	1	1	They are very similar because they are both specialists. A panda eat almost nothing but bamboo and a koala bear eats almost nothing except eucalyptus leaves. The difference between them and a python is that a python isn't an exclusive eater. It will eat almost anything.

Also, the article said that they mainly eat just one type of food. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because for one thing, they are not dangerous. Also, they only eat leaves mainly unlike in the article wen it said a python ate an alligator.
5240	3	0	0	A panda is similar to a koala bear because neither one of them is harmful. They both only eat plants, and they don't really bother humans, so they're not a threat. They differ from pythons because pythons are harmful and they will attack humans.
5241	3	1	1	The author says that koalas from Australia and pandas from China are both examples of specialists because they are basically native to one area and eat a certain diet.

5264	3	1	1	In the passage, paragraph 19-21, I explains generalists and specialists. Generalists can live anywhere and adapt to any place. Humans are the biggest generalists for example, but pythons are in this category too. Specialists are the opposite. They cant survive in many places because they cant adapt. Koala bears eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively, and China's panda bear eats just only bamboo. They  need those in.
5267	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because the both stick to one source of food and they live in one area. They are different from a python because pythons can live in a bunch of different climates and they eat different foods.

5277	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia due to the fact they are specialist. Which means they favor stability. The difference between them & the pythons is pythons are generalist that can adjust to change & in our changing World, They can do best in & around humans which koalas & pandas can't based on their classification.
5278	3	0	0	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eat planets and their specialist.

There specialist while pythons are generalist meaning they can survive in many different parts of the world not just one place.
5283	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both specialists. They survive on thing thing (pandas bamboo, koalas leaves). While a python is a generalist who has multiple food sources and can live in many places. paragraph 21 is a good example "A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo".
5284	3	0	0	Koalas and pandas are simillar. This is because they both survive on one thing basically. The python however, is a very abandant species as the panda and koala are more rare. The python is also more dangerous because does "best in and around humans."
5285	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are very similar to each other. For one, they are both specialists. The fact that they are specialists means they can only survive in a single, stable environment that can support them. They are both very different from python, because the python is a generalist, which means it could live just about anywhere.
5288	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are both vegatarians that eat bamboo and/or eucalyptus. As a opposed to pythons that eat meat. Pandas and koalas are specialists and pythons are generalists.
5289	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are specialists and only eat one food. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists. The python can live almost anywhere and eat a variety of things. Pandas can only eat, "nothing but bamboo", and koalas can only," eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
5291	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both plant eaters and are becoming extinct. They both differ to the python because the python is spreading rapidly. As stated in the article, ''many invasive species under go a lag before proliferating.'' which means that they are spreading rapidly.
5292	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia, because panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves all the time. They are different from pythons because pythons are 5 of the most dangerous species. The U.S. biological survey notes that pythons in Asia inhabit climates that are similar to those in about a third of the continental US.
5293	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialists animals. There are not a lot of them and they both only eat one thing. Pandas eat bamboo, while Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Both of these animals are different from pythons because pythons are abundant and will eat anything that they can get their rangs into.

5298	3	1	1	Pandas and koala bears are similar pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They don't eat meat. Pythons will pretty much eat anything. Pandas and koalas are both specialists,while a python is a generalist.
5299	3	0	0	The way that pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia and how they both are different from pythons is because, they both are specialists. They're different from a python because pythons are generalists.
5300	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are native from their country and are symbols of their country too. They also both only eat one thing exclusively panda: bambo & koalas; eucalyptus leaves. Their different from pythons because pythons eat other animals.
5304	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas from Australia are but different from pythons because in paragraph21 it states that pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. But pythons are canivores and says that a python ate an alligator and expaded.
5306	3	1	1	China's panda and Australia's koala are similar because they both eat mainly from one food source. The panda eats mostly bamboo and the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because a python will almost eat anything.
5307	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both considered specialists compared to the pythons who is a generalist. The article says that specialists prefer stability (the panda and koala both feed almost entirely off a single food) while generalists are more suited to change. A snake is able to adapt better than a koala or panda bear.
5308	3	1	1	The similarities between the panda and the koala are that they are specialists and mainly eat only one thing. The difference between pandas and koalas compared to pythons is that pythons eat almost anything. For example in the article it states "You could conceivably have pythons snacking their war right up the Potomac."
5309	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia, because of the limited food that they eat. Pandas almost only eats bamboos and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They both are different from pythons because pythons are heavy meat-eaters; and pandas and koalas are vegitarian.
5311	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist. They both usually only eat one kind of food: bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas. If these animals were taken from their food source chances are they would die. This is not like pythons, however pythons when given a mild to warm climate to live in, will adapt to the in surrounding and food would not a factor, As long as there are animals in their environment, pythons will have food. However pythons for the moment are not suitable fro colder climates.
5312	3	1	1	Pandas are similar to koalas because both eat leaves almost exclusively, they're different to pythons because pythons eat anything. According to the text, ''A python swallowed an alligator .'' In other words, pandas and koalas are not something to really worry about unlike pythons.
5313	3	1	1	The way the Chinease panda and the Australian koalas are alike is because they only eat one sorce of food, pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. On the other hand pythons eats mostly anything and everything it can.
5315	3	1	1	Well because China panda they don't eat almost nothing just bamboo and koala just eat eucalyptus so that is a food that they can jus find in their own ecosistem but in the case of the pythons they can eat almos everything like rats, cows, chicks, eggs etc.
5317	3	1	1	China's Pandas and Australian Koalas are similar it that they are both specialists, the pandas and Koala eat almost nothing but bamboo, arole eucalyptus, respectively, unlike pythons, which are generalists. Pythons can adapt to a wide variety of habitats and fond sounds.
5318	3	1	1	In the article it is stated that python is a generalist species while a panda or a koala is a specialist. What this means is that specialists clearly need an environment that they have fully developed too so they can survive ( the need for bamboo and eucalyptus leaves, Whereas pythons can survive anywhere as long as there is some temp influence on them and that is the difference.
5319	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both harmless. A specialist is China pandas which eat almost nothing but bamboo or Australia koala bear wich eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively but python is dangerous. A python swallowed in alligator and there's not a deinate way to put it explosed.
5321	3	0	0	The pandas and the koalas are similar because they are both animals that are forcing and that are harmless. Unlike the python, which is a deadly, venerous snake, the panda and koalas are left alone in there habitats, while the viable snakes (python) are brought to the U.S. In the story, it says how the panda only eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves, meaning they are herbavores.
5322	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Astralia because they are both specialists that eat only one type of food "China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo". They are different from a python is a generalist.
5323	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they eat bamboo bamboos (panda) and eucalyptus leaves (koala). They are both different from pythons because they are not vicious and attacking creatures. They are gentle, whereas a python is vicious and fierce-looking, always ready to attack. A python can even eat an alligator.
5324	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both part of the specialist species. A panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and a koala eats almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves. Because of this, they differ from pythons which are part of the generalist species. Pythons can live in many places and they do well around humans.
5325	3	1	1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Like it says in the article, china's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves. These both are different from pythons because like the article says, pythons are a generalist.
5326	3	1	1	Pandas tend to eat nothing but bamboo. They relate to koalas in Australia because koalas eat one specific food exclusively as well, eucalyptus. Pandas and koalas are both different from pythons because they are more prone to survive in almost any climate, while pandas live specifically in China and koalas in Australia. Pythons are more abundant.
5327	3	1	1	China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo. The koala eats eucalyptus leaves. They both don't eat meat. Pythons eat almost anything. "A python swallowed an alligator." As said in the article, pandas and koalas eat plants and pythons can eat anything.
5330	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar to pandather because the are exclusive to their habitats. pandas only live in China because of the bamboo and koalas line in Australia because they only eat the eucalyptus leaves. Both are different from pythons because pythons can adapted to different enviornments and food. An example would be how the pythons were introduced to Florida.
5331	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in many ways like it states in the passage "China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively" meaning that the two animals can live off eating one thing. They are different from pythons because unlike pythons, pandas and koala bears are not household pets.
5332	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are the same because they're both specialists. Each of them eats almost nothing but bamboo or eucalyptus leaves, which is also what makes them specialists, as stated in paragraph 21.
5333	3	1	1	Koalas and pandas are similar because they both only eat one type of food which is native to were they live, but pythons can adapt to different food sources making it easier for them to find food and survive.
5334	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koala's in Australia because they both eat one specific food that their habitat has. On the story it said pandas eat bamboo while koala's eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons can't eat only one thing and they are generalists.
5335	3	2	2	Panda's and koalas are surprisingly similar species. This is because they're specialist. They are limited to a particular region of the world because of their diet. While pythons are different because they're generalist, they can exist in a variety of environments because they can adapt. "What favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability" (Achenbanch5). In conclusion, pandas and koalas differ from pythons.
5336	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species, they eat almost exclusively one food. They are different from a python which is a generalist and eats more than one type of food.
5337	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koala in Australia because they both only eat food type of food in their natural habitat. They are both different from pythons because pythons just need to have  the right climate to survive  and they will adapt to the different food. For example Pandas only eat bamboo but a python will eat anything.
5338	3	0	0	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists as they are different from the python because the python is a generalists. There are more pythons because the word today "favors generalists rather than specialists" says one sentence in the article.
5339	3	1	1	From reading this article I can say pandas in China are much like koalas in Austrailia because both animals eat mainly one food. Pandas like to eat mainly bamboo and koalas like to eat mainly eucalyptus leaves. This quality puts both animals in the catagory of specialists. This differs from python because pythons are generalist. The article says generalists are human beings that live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to outer space, unlike pandas and koalas.
5341	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas bears in Australia are similar in that they are both specialist species. This means they are restricted to limited environments and only eat one type of food. As a result, these animals are less capable of adapting. A python however, is much more flexible. It is a generalist species better suited for survival. It is different also because it can live in different climates and eats different things.

10992	5	3	3	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it fits through the holes by virtue of being single-stranded. The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome. The ribosome latches on to the mRNA with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases, called a codon, at a time. The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome. A peptide (dehydration synthesis) bond forms between the two amino acids, and the initial tRNA is 'cut loose' The ribosome then moves on down the mRNA creating the protein coded for. A strand of mRNA can be translated several times.

Next, tRNA reads the codons and using its anticodons goes out into the cytoplasm to pick up the amino acid that corresponds. It then travels back to the mRNA and connects its amino acid with the one previously set before it. Once the tRNA reaches the stop codon, the polypeptide chain is released and a protein has formed.

Once the mRNA is within the ribosome, sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mRNA strand, otherwise known as a codon, and a corresponding anticodon attached to tRNA and an amino acid are signalled to attach.3.tRNA continues to attach itself to the mRNA strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome.

12396	5	1	1	There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placei n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.

Transfer RNA carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mRNA. The codon and anticodon bind, and form an amino acid. More and more tRNA molecules bring anticodons to the mRNA codons, which produce a growing polypeptide chain. This chain will be a protein.

14545	6	1	1	One process that a cell uses to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is the surface area. If the surface area is too large, the cell won't let any more substances move throughout the cell membrane. Another way is facilitated diffusion. This controls the amount of substances that are allowed to enter the cell.
14546	6	2	2	Diffusion is the process when a substance is transfered from inside the cell to outside.  This process does not require any energy.Active transport is the movement of substance from a low concentration to a high one.  This does require energy.Osmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane.  The cell membrane descides what water goes in and out of the cell.

14548	6	1	1	The cell can use passive transport, which allows things to freely move in and out of the cell given the concentration of the matter. Active transport uses energy from the cell to move materials against the gradient. One form of this moves materials out, called endosymbiosis. Another form moves them inside the cell, called exosymbiosis.

This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. The next process is passive transport. In passive transport, the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell.

14975	6	3	3	THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances. The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.

15049	6	3	3	The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.

15060	6	1	1	There are many ways a cells materials can enter of leave a cell. Endocytosis is how a cell takes in needed materials in which are to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell, and sodium to leave a cell. Sodium-potassium pumps only open one way at a time. For example, when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell, the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell can't move through. Endocytosis, Exocytosis, and sodium-potassium pump are three ways substances move across the cell membrane.

Making it hard for harmful substances to enter the membrane.
15068	6	3	3	Osmosis, which is the diffusion of water through a semi-permiable membrane, is one process that a cell uses to move substances across the cell membrane.Cells also use facilitated diffusion. In facilitated diffusion, glucose molecules, which normally would not be allowed to cross the cell membrane, is moved across the cell membrane through protein pumps.Active transport is also used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane. In normal diffusion, water moves from high concentration to low concentration, but with active transport, the cell uses energy to move substances from low concentration to high concentration.

15211	6	3	3	Three processes that are used by a cell to control movement are osmosis, diffusion, and active transport. Osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane. It requires no energy, so it is called anerobic. Diffusion is the movement of particles in a cell from high to low concentration, this process also uses no energy because it goes with the concentration gradient. Active transport is the movement of particles in a cell from low to high concentration, this process uses energy, or ATP, because it goes against the concentration gradient.

When they are switched to MRNA also known as messenger rna that sends a message to the organelles stating that the genetic code needs a specific substance. The third process  is TRNA or transfer rna which transfers the message to the specific orgnelle. The whole process then repeats itself.
15251	6	3	3	Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.

Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy. Two types of active transport are endocytosis, the process of letting materials into the cell, and exocytosis, the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell.

15477	6	2	2	Diffusion is used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.  Substances transfer from high concentration to low concentration.  Active transport is also used.  ATP is important in taking the substances across the membrane.  ATP allows the substances to go against the concentration gradient.  Protein carriers also control movement of substances.  Protein carriers go through a distinct process to engulf the substance and then release it back in or out of the cell.  All of these are examples of different ways cells control the movement of substances across the membrane.

Lastly, the cell membrane acts as a protector to protect the cell from anything that could possibly harm or damage it.
15674	6	1	1	One process is active transport, which is transport with the aid of transport proteins. Transport proteins help to get the substances to move through the plasma membrane. Another process is passive transport, which is not very differet from active transport, except this transport does not use the aid of transport proteins. The substances move without them.A third process is exocytosis or endocytosis.Exocytosis is the secreting or expelling of unwanted materials or wastes.Endocytosis is the surrounding and engulfing of materials.

16955	7	1	1	Rose can be described by the trait of responsability. This is shown because she has a job, but still manages to do her homework. This can be very hard to do sometimes but she is responsible enough to do it.
16956	7	2	2	Rose is thoughtful and caring.  She has plenty of topics or activities in her life that she could be complaining about; however she puts others before herself.       For example in the story Aunt Kolab asks Rose if the work she does to help the family 'weighs her down'.  Rose did not want to tell her the truth because she did not want to hurt her aunt.  Therefore, one can see Rose cares about others emotions and can be characterized as thoughtful.
16957	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose is understanding. When she was talking to Anna, Anna was saying that she is lonesome for Papa and that it feels like he has been gone for years. Rose understands that even though it hurts his family emotionally, Papa had to take the job in Los Angeles to give his family a better life. She says to Anna that it has only been four months since he left and that he gets paid three times what he was making there.
16960	7	2	2	Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose comes across as understanding. She explains to Anna that even though it's hard on them, they each have their part to do for the family in order to help during difficult times. This shows that she understands the families struggles and realizes they need her help. Even though she feels slight resentment for this, she surpresses these feelings while explaining the situation to Anna because she understands thatn the family needs them to help out.
16961	7	0	0	Rose conversations were based on there trait there are all from cambodia
16962	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is stressed.

16965	7	2	2	Rose is a very optimistic person. In her conversation with Anna, Rose always looks at things as if they were for the better and that they will have a good outcome. When they are talking about their father who moved away to get a better job Anna is complaing about how they never get to see him anymore but Rose is looking at it from the other point of view, that he did it to get more money to help support his family and to send his girls to college.
16966	7	2	2	she is caring she doesnt want to tell her aunt because she is  afraid she is going to make her feel bad.
16967	7	0	0	Rose is pressured.  She reveals this trait as she talks about the dream she has, and in the fact that she does not answer her aunt when Rose is asked by her if she feels weighted down by all she does to help her family.

16974	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is selflessness. I know this because when she is talking to Anna and Anna tells her how she is feeling Rose responds with, 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' She is feeling overwhelmed but does not mention it to her sister.
16975	7	1	1	Based on Rose's attitude from the story, she seems like she cares a lot about her family, but is also worried about her family. Even though she seems worried or doubtful, one line in the story she says to her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' In this sentence, it sounds like she has a little bit of faith also.
16976	7	0	0	I think shes just feelin alot of pressure with all that shes doing. so the trait i think she has is patience. She's always waiting onand helping others. One detail from the story that shows me this is, when it sasys, 'The day, like most of her days, had been to long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the resturaunt to work a four hour shift, then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper.'She's always helping others, and i think that means she has patience.
16977	7	2	2	From her conversations, Rose seems to be a caring individual, in the way that she tried to comfort Anna and in her kind and gentle behavior towards Aunt Kolab when asked if this lifestyle was difficult. She cares about her family enough to work a job to help support the family and send her brother to college and seems to be caring enough to help carry the entire family.
16978	7	1	1	Rose is grateful. She is willing to help the family whenever it is needed. She is willing to get a job and helped pay for her college education and also Anna's, her younger sister. In the story it says in a different way that she is proud of her heritage and how she lives.
16979	7	2	2	In the story Rose is a very giving person. She tries to help pay for her brothers college and do an essay to receive a prize. She works all the time just to help her brother. That is why she is a very giving person.
16980	7	1	1	She is steadfast in her loyalty to her family.  Even though she is tired of working, homework and her essay she keeps on going.  She is hoping her life will get better.
16981	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is responsible.  'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding.  From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.  After that it was time to do homework.'  This shows that Rose has a lot of things to do and makes sure she takes care of everything.
16982	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is thoughtful. Rose is thoughtful because in the story she is trying to help her sister understand that their father had take the other job for the money.
16983	7	0	0	Rose and Anna both want their mom and dad to stop working so late at night and Rose thinks that Anna should try and find out if she could get some time off work to do her work from school.
16984	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is that she is caring. Rose cares for her sister and family, even to the point where she will hide her true feelings to make her sister feel better. When Rose was having a converstaion with Anna, she spoke gentely trying to word her sentences to make it seem that it was not that big of deal that their dad was gone. Based on her converstation with Anna, Rose seems to be a thoughtful and caring person.
16985	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person.  In paragraph 4, when Anna wakes up from having a bad dream, Rose tries her best to comfort her sister.  She speaks in a gentle voice, so as not to increase the despair that her younger sister is feeling. While speaking to Anna, Rose displays this specific character trait.  Anna was not completely satisfied with Rose's answer, but she still was able to go back to sleep.  In this, I think Rose shows the readers that she is indeed a caring person.
16986	7	0	0	If i had to show one trait from Rose it would be based the conversation with Anna. Traits I can see from this conversation is she is in a way nieve.

By beind too afraid of telling her aunt how she truly feels and by just assuring Anna that their parents are doing their best for the family, this character seems to keep her true opinions to herself.
17010	7	1	1	Rose is a woman of many different personalities and traits, but there is one trait in perticular that stands out.  Rose is a determined woman, she is willing to do anything and everything for the better of her family, and is willing to fit everything she can into her day.  an example from the story is, 'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding'.

An example of how Rose is a responsible young lady is because during her conversation with her aunt she doesnt respond when her aunt asks her 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family.'

17107	7	0	0	One trait that stands out to me mostly in Rose is fear of what she must do for her brother and how so much responsibility is laid on such a young girl. According to the passage, Rose thinks to herself, 'Paul's fate lies partly in these', referring to her hands. That statement represents that she is thinking about what she has been doing for her brother to go to college and how her brother's getting into college shouldn't rely on her.

When Anna talks about how she misses her father, Rose explains to her that he had to go to make a living, and that he would be back soon.
17120	7	0	0	Rose is a good person and wants to do everything she can for the family. When she talks to Aunt Kolab, and when her Aunt offers to sell some baked goods, Rose feels a burden lifted off her shoulders. One exmple from the story, is that when her Aunt asks 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose doesn't answer, because she didn't want to hurt her aunt, and she just wanted to continue to help the family.
17121	7	0	0	By the time Rose tiptoed into their room, Anna was already snoring lightly. Rose slid into bed and watched the lights from passing cars move across the walls. They became the light that had illuminated the stage att Paul's high school graduation.
17122	7	1	1	From this story I think the best trait to describe Rose is that she's unselfish.  You can see why Rose is unselfish when she talks about how even if she won the essay competition she couldn't go get her prize from Sacramento because she wouldn't be able to take off of her work which helps support her family.  This part of the passage helps you see that Rose puts her family before herself.
17123	7	1	1	Rose seems to be a strong person that can take care of her family. Even though she isn't the mother, she is taking care of her and other's responsibilities. When Rose fake laughed to help comfort her sister, it showed that she actually cares and she is a mother-like figure to Anna.
17124	7	2	2	I think that one trait of Rose that i picked up from her conversations is that she is very hard working. She shook her head yes to her aunts question of the situation being difficult for her. She knows it is difficult and she knows that the outcome of her work will be better for her and her sister, but yet she still works reallyhard to get her brother to college. That shows me that she is definitaly a hard worker because she is doing it so she can go on and work even harder to get to where she wants to be in life.
17125	7	2	2	Rose is compassionate. Rose asks how Anna feels, she would not ask this unless she cares about her. The reason she cares about her is that Anna is Rose's sister

17148	7	2	2	A trait that well describes Rose is that she puts other peoples feelings above her own, and she cares more of how others feel than herself. An example is in paragraph 19 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'

The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'

In the story, it states that Anna says, 'You sound just like Mama.' This shows that Rose has the traits of a mother figure in their relationship. Since Rose is the older sister, she has to look over her little sister when her mother is gone.

In the story as Rose and Anna were talking Anna says 'Money isn't everything Rose' and then Rose replies 'Not if you already have everything.' And to me this is just like saying that Rose wouldn't be happy unless she had everything.
17198	7	0	0	She said that she feels like she is the one who is supporting the family and that she feels weighed down because of it. When Rose is talking to Anna, she states how she feels about her father leaving, and that upsets Anna.

In paragraph 23 of the text it states, 'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'  By listening to what her aunt had to say and stepping back to see the whole situation, Rose gained the hope that she wouldn't be stressed for long.

17216	7	0	0	One trait of Rose is that she is obediant. She retains her feelings while talking with her Aunt Kolab in the kitchen, even though she really dislikes the fact that she has to work to put her older brother through college.

17221	7	1	1	Rose is a very respectful person. While she was talking with her aunt she did not want to tell her how she truly felt because she believed it would upset her, and the rest of the family. Rose likes to put other people before herself. She is a caring person but she sometimes doesn't understand when it is to much. After talking with her aunt she realized that she couldnt weigh herself down with other peoples problems. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That quote is from the story, and that quote is what made me infer what type of person Rose was. She does her best to help people, especially the ones she loves, and in the end she is just weighing herself down. That is the heart of a true caring person, and not only a caring person, but a strong person as well.
17222	7	0	0	One thing that describes Rose is that she is over worked and tired.  One detail is that most of her days had been too long, too demanding.  From school she had gone stright to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, than stright home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.

17229	7	0	0	In Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab, her Aunt asks 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' She remains quiet. I feel that this reaction sums up how she is feeling, she is stressed yet she doesn't want to hurt her family. She wants to help, because she loves her family, though she is struggling.
17230	7	0	0	Ignorant, because she didn't give up on all here work to do. She kept on goin and found a solution.
17231	7	0	0	Her life can get easier maybe it wouldnt .so it might ot might not.

17238	7	0	0	The fate of rose lies in Pauls hands, her aunts trying to help her by making her feel lighter, and made her think of a topic.
17239	7	2	2	I believe that Rose is careing. In the conversation she had with her Aunt Kolab, about the dream, rose did not want to explain to her aunt the way she felt, because she felt that she would hurt her aunt by telling her the way she felt. I think that when someone puts someone elses feelings, or thoughts before their own is a careing person.
17240	7	0	0	Anna is a VERY smart girl and the reason I think that is because she was gone do a three-thousand word essay.
17241	7	0	0	Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.

17246	7	1	1	She is caring. She talks to her sister, lessons to her and tells her that money isn't everything.
17247	7	0	0	In the story your perspective is from Rose.  Rose, like other humans, has many traits to her personality.  One trait that you can see is giving.  An example of this is how she works to help her brother get through college.  She seems to be constantly busy, but doesn't outrightly complain about it.  This is an example of a trait I find Rose has.
17248	7	0	0	To me, Rose seems like a competitive girl. She doesn't want to loose. Meaning by that, the fact stating, she has to write a three thousand word essay. Rose says, 'Even if I win, I won't get to travel to sacremento to recieve the prize.' This means she wants to win. She won't give up on her dreams.
17249	7	0	0	I think Rose is decribed as a hard worker an is exhausted. In the passage it replies, 'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' This example supports my answer why i think Rose is decribed as a hardworker an is exhausted.
17250	7	0	0	Strong, in paragragh tweenty three she realized that her family could survive an ocean crossing.
17251	7	2	2	'Anna,'Rose said 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' from this part of the story i felt that she was caring.
17252	7	2	2	When Rose says that he has only been gone for four months and he is getting paid three times as much in Los Angeles. It shows that Rose a mature and understanding person, partly because she feels obligated to.

17254	7	0	0	She worries a lot about if she will beable to go to college or if she would be able to do anything. This is shown when Rose starts to talk about how her brother must have felt during the time he was there and that now that he is in college he might have to help pay to get his family higher in the world. Also with all the rsponsibility he had when he was there is now passed on to Rosa which is causing her to not have any time to do anything.
17255	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has in the story is that she works hard for the success of others, and does not think about the affects on her. When Rose is tired from working and helping her aunt, she must then do her homework. She does not have much time to do so, and is often too tired to even finish. This proves that she believes she can help make a difference for Paul, and that he will return the favor. Even though Rose is extremely busy helping her family put her brother through college, she surpresses her real feelings to her family because she must do her part. In the story Rose supports this claim by thinking. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' This is showing that she does not want to work and instead focus on school, but she knows what she must do, and is afraid of hurting her family. In the story, Rose is a hard worker, and respects other's feelings.
17256	7	0	0	One trait that Rose is dealing with is poverty. Rose feels she does not do enough to help. Rose's father moved else-where to get more money for the family. Paul is going to college trying to make it through. Poverty is sad to say is what trait Rose was stricten with.

17261	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose from her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is caring. Rose is caring as shown through the part of the story where she is cautious to tell her Aunt Kolab that she feels weighed down by the support she offers the family.  Rose takes time to ponder if she should tell her Aunt Kolab because she fears she will hurt her, and her mother.  Rose does not want to hurt her family, therefore she is caring.
17262	7	2	2	Based on the conversations between Rose and Anna, Rose seems to be a person who is trying to be positive and strong for her family.  When Anna brings up their missed father, she blames him for leaving the family.  Rose tries to explain to her that he only left the family because they needed the money.

17276	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversations would be Stubborn, I think that Rose is very stubborn and somewhat ungrateful. she is stubborn because she complains about everything, she doesnt take anything for granted and never wants to give up on what she wants. In a way its a good thing that Rose is stubborn because people cant take advantage of her and she wont stop trying something until she wins. But on the other hand she can hurt people and can be annoying. this is the trait I chose that best fits Rose.

17289	7	0	0	Rose is a very busy girl, often tied down with taking care of her sister Anna, and wanting her mother home. But she finds herself in a self centered position and would complain about how terrible her life is. At the end of this story, She realized that she can survive this family splitting all by herself when she said, 'Suddenly it occurred to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague.

Thus a prominent characteristic of Rose is her unwillingness to accept the desparation of her family's condition, taking burdens upon her to help convince herself that things are going normally.
17295	7	2	2	One trait that descibes Rose based on the conversation between her and Anna is that she is helpful in many ways. To me it seems that Rose is more of the mother figure in Anna's life and is there for her when she needs something. She helps tries to help out with the money situation by working. An example of the book of how Rose shows this trait is when Anna woke up and came into where Rose was, Rose asked if she was alright and if she felt okay.
17296	7	0	0	In the story Rose is hesatent to tell her feelings because she doesnt want to hurt anyone. She says'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'. I think that Rose is shy and that she wants to make things work for her family but she doesnt want to have to hurt anyone in trying to do so.
17297	7	2	2	Rose is a hard worker and worries a lot. Rose is very persistent. One example is in paragraph two. Im paragraph it talks about how much homework she has to do. Then how she has to work to help support her entire family.
17298	7	1	1	Rose is helpful.  She works to help support Paul and the rest of her family.  Anna and Aunt Kolab both talk about the problems that are occuring because of all the things that they have to do to support the family.
17299	7	0	0	Rose seems a bit overloaded according to her conversation with Aunt Kolab
17301	7	1	1	Rose is a hardworker. In the beginning of the story, she explains going to school, heading straight to work for a four-hour shift, and then straight home to help make dinner. After all of that, she still has to do homework.
17302	7	2	2	She cares for her family. When she talks to Anna she said 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17303	7	0	0	Rose can be decribed as patient during her conversation with Anna.  When she tries to to explain to Anna why everyone is trying to work so hard to help Paul finish college, she calmly speaks to Anna, even though she knows Anna may not fully understand.  Even though Anna clearly did not understand what Rose was saying, she does not lose her temper or show any negative reaction towards Anna's retort at the end of the conversation.  Instead, she remains tolerant, which takes a great deal of patience on her part.
17304	7	2	2	Rose is a person who puts others before herself and wants to be helpful. 'Rose didn't answer. If she to;d the truth she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mom' this describes her puting her familly before herself.
17306	7	1	1	I think a trait that Rose has is caring. Rose is caring because she cares about her family and understands what things are going on and tries to help her sister understand. She also is like a leader to her sister.
17307	7	0	0	She seems somewhat self centered for example when her sister walks in the room she asks, 'whats wrong? You feel okay?', and when the sister replies that she had a bad dream she doesnt ask why or what happend.
17308	7	1	1	She understands the importance of finacial need. When she stated that her dad moved away to another job that paid three times what he was making before, reveals that she has some intelligance in money.
17309	7	0	0	Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab suggests that Rose is very mature and responsible for her age. Rose's aunt can see how much stress she is under. Rose doesn't say anything though, knowing the family needs money to survive. When Aunt Kolab says something to Rose about being 'weighed down by helping the family,' Rose admits she's under much stress.
17310	7	0	0	There mad that their mom has to work so late.''Mamas not home yet is he', 'I hate how late she has to work'
17311	7	1	1	One trait that describes Rose would have to be that she hard working. She works for what her family needs so that there lives can become better.
17312	7	2	2	She cares about her sister Anna. This is supported by Rose asking Anna 'whats wrong'? and 'are you feeling ok'?
17313	7	0	0	When Rose's sister walked and asked what's worng? Rose tried to tell than she was fine that just she had another bad dream. Rose's sister said the money isn't everything, then Rose tell to her sister than they have to help Paul, so Anna dislike for that. 'You sond just like Mama'. Anna wants to mean that Rose start to think and talk like her mother.
17314	7	0	0	One trait that can descibe Rose is exhausted.she is exhausted because of everything that she must do for herself and the family. She must work at a restaurant after school and then go strait home to make supper and she still has homework to do. Rosa is a very buisy person and does not have enough time for herself or her homework.
17315	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstation with Aunt Kolab is that she is caring. That she cares what other people feel and how what she says may hurt the other person. The statement that supports my answer would be 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mom.' That indicated that she cared what she could have said would hurt her aunt and that her aunt could very well tell her mom. She was probably scared it would hurt her mother too.
17316	7	0	0	Rosa feels that she weiged down by her family, and theres is not much she can do about it.  The floashback that involved her brother  standing on top of her in the water, sybolizes herfeeling weiged down and no able to get much help.
17317	7	0	0	The conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab was a good sisters relationship.
17318	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversations with Anna is pessimistic. She doesn't believe that their life will get better as fast as Anna would like it to. You can see that by Anna saying that money isn't everything and her enthusiasm as she talks about how Paul will graduate college and help pay for their college fees. Rose acts accordingly and compares Anna to her mother, which shows that Anna and her mother are the optimistic characters of the story.
17319	7	0	0	1. she doesn't like to see people disappointed or u- happy. for example 'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
17320	7	0	0	Rose is a self-absorbed American teenager.  She feels sorry for herself and believes she has a great burdon on her shoulders.  She does not realize that all of her family has had to work hard.  Her Aunt realize that she is like this because of where she was raised.  Since Rose feels she has to much burden, Aunt Kolab says, 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal'.
17321	7	0	0	I think that Rose seems lonely and that is why she has so much in her life. She works to help out the family but at the same time when she is home she does school work and helps out with supper. I think that she feels the same way Anna does but doesnt want to admit it. With her doing all of these things she has no time to miss her mom, dad, or even Paul.
17322	7	1	1	She works hard for her family. She went to school, worked for four hours after, then had to help her aunt with dinner, after she had homework that must be completed. She had no time to finish the essay.
17323	7	1	1	She is wanting to make everything good for her and her family because her dad is gone, so she is working very hard to keep up. But it is alot of work and she is having trouble getting everything done in time. Like she came from school and went straight to the resturant to work for four hours, then straight home to help her aunt make supper, and then had to try to get a essay done and she didn't have a topic yet.
17324	7	2	2	Rose seems to be a very kind and caring person and wants to help other people. ''Anna,' Rose said.'what's wrong? You feel okay?''
17325	7	1	1	She is a very hard worker. She works four hours at her job then comes home to help make supper and then writes her essay.
17326	7	0	0	Rose seems like a truthfull person because she tells Anna about their dad being gone for only four months and that he is making better money.
17327	7	1	1	Rose did not want to hurt her Aunt. She doesn't like hurting people. So she wasn't going to tell her Aunt that she felt so weighed down by what she was doing for her family.
17328	7	1	1	Hardworking. Rose is a very hard working individual. She has school, work, housework, and homework. She takes on more responsibilites than she can probably handle but she does it all for the good of the family. You can see Rose's hardworking efforts as she goes above and beyond to win a essay contest. She puts more on her plate than she can eat but she takes every challenge head on. You can tell she is working hard from the stress that is related to us through her character. She is strong for her sister, making everything seem just peachy, but right when she has the chance, she breaks down to her Aunt, let's her know how she really feels.
17329	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is hardworking. Whether she wants to do something or not, she still gets it done. An example from the story is the fact that she goes to school, works a four- hour shift right after, home to help her aunt  prepare supper, and then does homework.
17330	7	0	0	Rose was very busy on a normal day to day basis. I know this because of how stressed she is that she does not have time to write her paper, because of school, work, preparing supper, and doing homework.
17331	7	0	0	Rose is heart felt girl who cannot let the past go due to some excructiating experiences as a young girl. Rose has re-occurring dreams about things of her brother. An example would be she has a vision of her brother recieving his diploma and she also has a dream of her brother jumping from a boulder and sinking down upon herself as if he was made of stone.
17332	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstations with Anna is that she knows how to push things to the side that she knows upsets her deep down and say what she thinks the true facts are.  One example from the story that shows this is when Anna and Rose are talking about her father being gone and to Anna it seemed like it had been years that he had been gone.  Rose jus responded with a simple answer of, 'It's only been four months.'
17333	7	0	0	That Rose didnt answer if she told the truth or not
17334	7	2	2	Rose said ' What's wrong? You feel okay?' that is a trait of love.
17335	7	2	2	Rose is a rather optimistic person. Although she is very stressed out due to the work she must do daily, she seems hopeful that all her efforts will pay off, whether it be for Paul, her parents, or herself.
17336	7	0	0	Rose feels very weighed down because she has too much on her plate and it drives her insane because she also has to do a bunch for her family too and she feels presured not to give up and to help as much as she can and I know this because of when she had that conversation with her aunt at the end she had her aunt explain what she was feeling in a different perspective.
17337	7	2	2	Rose is very selfless, she shows this by not saying how she really felt when she was asked by her aunt. Instead of hurting her aunt and mother she kept it to herself.
17338	7	2	2	Rose is very caring about her family. She sacrificed so much time to get a job and help pay, along with her family, to get her brother through college. Of course, it doesn't mean that she is happy about it all the time, but she still does care and wants to try somehow to help as much as she can.
17339	7	0	0	She don't like to her peoples feelings because she don't tell her anut the truth about whats really makes her feel weigh down by what shes doing to help her family.
17340	7	0	0	Even if I win, she thought, I won't get to travel to Sacarmento to recieve the prize.
17341	7	0	0	To try to confort her the people that she see in dis stress. in the story she tries to make a  joke on how money isn't every thing to poeple that have everything.
17342	7	2	2	She hides her feelings so she doesnt upset others, like when she didn't want to tell the truth and hurt her Aunt.
17343	7	0	0	It is easily surmisable from the text that Rose can be described as burdened.  It is enough proof to deduce her burdened and troubled mind set when the story describes her dreams as she feels that the weight of her brother is crashing down on her.
17344	7	2	2	One trait that I saw in Rose during her conversation with Anna is that she is a positive person she is telling her sister the positive things that will come out of it. Also, that even though she feels weighed down by everything she is still keeping her head up and staying positive. For example, Rose said to Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17345	7	0	0	Rose is a nervous person, she's saying, 'even if i win, i wount get to travel to Sacramento to recieve the prize.
17346	7	0	0	Rose and Anna both have a hard time writting an essay. When they get mad they don't want to do it anymore and they walk off.
17347	7	0	0	Rose is paranoid. She is paranoid with how her life is going with her mother working late and her father moving away to work somewhere else.  This is shown when she keeps having bad dream.
17348	7	0	0	'I feel asleep working on my essay,' Said Rose                                               Rose was doing her essay and she feel asleep and had a bad dream and she woke up scared and Anna ask if she was ok and Rose said yaq i am ok.
17349	7	0	0	One trait I identified was that she was more preoccupied with what was going on with her then however eveybody else felt.A detail from the story is when Rose ignored what her sister had to say and went on about her essay. She was more concerned about the essay then Rose's bad dream or how she was feeling.
17350	7	1	1	The one trate I would identify Rose with would be understanding. She shows this trait when she explains to Anna why Papa had to leave.
17351	7	0	0	I think she is desolate and worn out. She works all the time to help her family and has no time for herself.
17352	7	0	0	Rose feels overworked and wants an easier life. This based on when Aunt Kolab asked her if it's difficult for her to imagine life in Cambodia.
17353	7	1	1	Rose is very responsible. She spends her days at school, then going to work, then preparing supper, and then doing homework. She is dutiful because she is trying to prepare for her future at college and helping Paul pay for his.
17354	7	2	2	One trait that can describes rose based on a conversation with Aunt Kolab is that you can really feel what Rose is actually feeling. You can almost make a connection, with Rose and how she has to deal with life, for example in the passage it says if she told the truth she would hurt her Aunt. So you get a feeling of how Rose feels on the inside too. You feel that she really cares for her family and doesn't want to upset anyone.
17355	7	1	1	Rose has a great trait, the trait she has is will-power. Rose does a lot for the family and she doesn't really ask for anything in return.'Rose didn't answer one of Aunt Kolab's questions because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.'
17356	7	1	1	Rose is an caring person who cares about others and how they feel and she is not self-centered. She is an trustworthy person and is very reliable. And she tends to be shy sometimes but she overcomes it a little bit.
17357	7	0	0	Rose is under a lot of pressure.Paragraph 3 says she has to write a flawless three-thousand word essay.
17358	7	0	0	She had a lot of flash backs, and it was coming all back to her sister because it was about her brother.
17359	7	0	0	Rose is a very afraid to let any one down.  This trait is both good and bad for her personality.  It is a good thing because, she is always there when someone needs something.  She would do anything to help someone around her.  It is bad because as Rose's dream shows us; Rose can be taking on to much and doesn't know how to let it all go, and tell people she can't handle it.
17360	7	0	0	Rose is very well at thinking before she speaks. In paragraph 19, she thaught about what to say because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
17361	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person. She wants her family to be well of and live a good life. She did not want to hurt her aunt by telling her that she felt weighed down by all she does. Rose was trying to calm her sister when she was sulking about missing their father. I see Rose as a caring girl.
17362	7	0	0	One trait that can discribe Rose is she woulod like everything to be her way and if it does not go her way she does not wont to do it.'Ann is mom home yet .' 'Rose know i wish she would come home earlyer and not late all the time dad never did that and that would help me a lot if she came home earlyer.'
17363	7	0	0	Rose is the type of person that is afraid to tell the truth if she thinks that it is going to hurt someone elses feelings.  The reason I say this is because in paragraph nineteen it says, Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probabaly her aunt would tell her mother.
17364	7	0	0	When Rose is talking to Anna after anna pours two glasses of orange juice, Rose says that she is lonesome for Papa. He has been gone for four months which seems like he had been gone for years.
17365	7	1	1	She works really hard and its for her family. She would do anything for her family and they would do the same for her.She is over working herself though. She needs to get her essay done and work at the restaurant and help cook at her house. But she does it anyway.For her brother.
17366	7	2	2	In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, we can see that Rose is tactful because she does not tell her aunt the truth for fear that she would hurt Aunt Kolab's feelings or that the aunt would tell Rose's mother and it would hurt her mother's feelings.
17367	7	0	0	Rose is not a person who will easily express her feelings. In her conversation with Anna, she sounded like she was perfectly content and not stressed by the fact that she has to help Paul get through college. It takes a strange dream and some probing by Aunt Kolab to get her to reveal her true feelings about the situation.
17368	7	0	0	I think that Rose is strong. In the story, it says that she was talking to her sister in the kitchen and that she was trying to help her sister understand their situation and help her come to better terms with it even though she felt the same way.
17369	7	0	0	I think that at the end of the story she finally understandsthe strength of her culture and how her aunt was using it to make her feel better and lighter.
17370	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is worried. She is worried that her older brother is going to weigh her down. The dream in which Paul sinks like a rock on top her supports my answer.
17371	7	0	0	They are both kinda upset that their dad had to go to Los Angelous for his work.  They both knew that he was making more money that ever.
17372	7	0	0	One trait that I can see in Rose is that she doesn't want to her her aunt by telling her the truth.  Also, by listening to her Aunt Kolab she is starting to think her life might get easier.  I think the reason is her Aunt Kolab seems to help people see the good in life.
17373	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose's trait would be while shes listening to Aunt Kolab. She doesn't directly answer her aunt cause she's afraid of hurting her aunt, or her aunt telling her mother. For instance Aunt Kolab says 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded.
17374	7	0	0	she is a busy body, cause she always has stuff to do.
17375	7	0	0	BUSY'When would she have time to squeeze writing into her schedule
17376	7	0	0	she is always busy
17377	7	1	1	Rose showed that she is very understanding when she had her conversation with Aunt Kolab. As her aunt helps her think of other things and helps her keep her hope up by pointing out the bright side of things, Rose nods away at what Aunt Kolab says. Although she still questions it in her head, she understands that maybe there is still something for her in her future.
17378	7	1	1	That she is worried about her family.
17379	7	1	1	Rose seems to be very kind. She didn't want her aunt to feel bad and also stuck up for her dad in her conversation with Anna.
17380	7	0	0	Rose is a very busy girl. She has to deal with being in high school, having a job, helping her Aunt Kolab with house work, and she has to write a three thousand word essay.
17381	7	2	2	One trait that can descibe rose based on her conversations is that she is caring.  I think Rose is caring because her young sister is sad because she misses her dad.  Rose tries to comfort her and tries to tell her that their dad had to go away to make more money.
17382	7	0	0	She grew up here and here mom and everybody else grew up in Cambodia. She has a dream that her brother is a heavy weight sinking  her down to the bottom of a body of water, and that gives her the oppurnity to see the situation through someone elses eyes.
17383	7	2	2	Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose can be described as caring because she puts her sister's needs before her own. Although she needs to write a three thousand word essay, she is more concerned that her sister had a bad dream and is missing their father.
17384	7	2	2	Rose is very thankful. Even if what her aunt offered did not work it still make a difference in how she felt. What her aunt did was take some stress away and give Rose a little hope.
17385	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has is that she understands some things have to be sacrificed for the better of the family.  This appears when she is talking with Anna in the kitchen after they both wake up.  Anna says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa.  It seems like he's been gone for years,' (para. 8).  Rose's response is, 'He had to go.  The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here,' (para. 9).  This shows that for her age and the amount of responsibility she has, she still understands that the sacrifice for a family is the most important thing of all.
17386	7	2	2	Rose can be described by hopeful.  She is hoping or wanting more to come out of the future.  When Rose and Anna are talking at the beginning of the story, Rose talks about how once Paul finishes college, he will get a good job and help support the rest of the family and help pay for both of them to go to college.
17387	7	0	0	Rose was nice to her sister at first, But then kinda got angry. In the story they were talking about their dad, and Rose made Anna mad.
17388	7	0	0	I feel like rose is very stressed. In the second paragraph, the first sentence, rose talks about how most of her days were long and too demanding. Then it describes in the third paragraph how she doesn't feel like she will have time to squeeze in her essay.
17389	7	1	1	Personally, I believe that Rose is sincere. She is trying to help her family, to the best of her ability, but she is heavily weighed down by circumstances. In this story, Rose goes through her to-do list for a typical evening. You would think that the list would be much shorter for someone her age, but then you realize what she has to sacrifice to keep her family going. I wish we could all have her sincerety.
17390	7	1	1	The one trait that Rose has is to work hard fo rher family to get by without some of her family memebers. I get this support because her sister and her have a talk about mone yand that her dad is gone and her mother works a long shift just to get money for them to survive.
17391	7	1	1	One trait that describes Rose is a hard worker.  She goes to school every day, then goes to wrork, and eventually she comes home and only has time to do homework.  She still get everything done and that is why Rose is a hard worker.
17392	7	0	0	she isnt very happy
17393	7	2	2	I would say Rose is an understanding person. In the story you can tell she just wants the best for her family. She is understanding of why her father has to live in L.A. and why her mother has to work so late. She is trying to win a prize for an essay but realizes she might not be able to travel to get. She is a determined bright young girl who is very understanding.
17395	7	2	2	She seems hopeful, even though she has it rough. When she was telling her sister about how Paul was gonna help them after he graduated college and got a good job, Anna was the one acting grouchy and like she didn't really believe it was going to work out.
17396	7	0	0	She seems iritated and tired, because in the story she wakes up and says oh, no and groaned. This shows that she is very unpleased and that she is very tired and irritable.
17397	7	2	2	She cares about others. She didn't answer her aunt because, she didn't want to hurt her.
17398	7	1	1	She is determined to help the family but feels to young to take on the challenge of growing up so fast.
17399	7	0	0	she is tiered of all the pressure that she is on like takeing care of her family, and writing 1000 word essay, than the pressure for paul.
17400	7	0	0	Rose tells Anna and Aunt Kolab that she is in some way being weighed down. Rose had a dream that Paul was holding her down.
17401	7	0	0	Rose is the kind of person that is very straight forward bout things. In the passage she tells her sister things that she may not wanna hear.
17402	7	1	1	I believe that in the story Rose is a very brave responsibal girl. During the story she is charged with taking care of her familuy while also living in a new country.
17403	7	1	1	In the story the conversation with rose and aunt Kolab would describe Rose as a helping person. She dosen't mind helping out in the family but, meanwhile at the end of the day she feels exhausted and wish she could tell her aunt but not in a way that will hurt her or her mother.
17404	7	0	0	Rose is dismissive and a little passive. She answers her aunt truthfully, but only with non-verbal communication. This shows shes dissmissve for the subject.
17405	7	0	0	Rose appears to feel overwhelmed by everything that is thrown at her- a rough job, taxing schoolwork, and a homelife that takes up most of the time she has that would normally be free to anyone else. '...From school she'd gone straight to the  restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.'
17406	7	1	1	Well she is caring and nice.
17407	7	2	2	Rose is exhausted but she is too nice to let anyone know when she talks to Aunt Kolab. She is caring because she didnt tell the truth because she didnt want to hurt her aunt or her mother.
17408	7	2	2	concernedi think she is concerned for her family and how her brother is the one that has to be the one that suports her and her little sister anna. she says she is concerned about her mother having to work so late .
17409	7	0	0	Rose seems to be worried about money in her coversation with Anna, a detail that supprts this when she brings up the fact that her dad is making more money now , away from them, than he did with them.
17410	7	2	2	In the passage 'Crossing Over', Rose has many different traits, but the trait that is most evident to me is her mother like responsibility. When Anna wakes up from a bad dream Rose checks on her and asks her 'What's wrong?' This suggest that she is wanting to take care of Anna. Then when Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her lets the reader know that Rose has a big resposibility with the family. When her aunt says, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. This implies to the reader that she has a lot of resposibility to take care of the family. The two examples that are given are small but imply much more that, Rose is almost like a second mother for her family.
17411	7	0	0	Rose is
17412	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is that she never get angry at the people she loves. Rose and Anna have to help Paul finish college and when Paul is out of college he'll pay for Rose and Anna.
17413	7	2	2	One trait that Rose shows is compasion. She cares about everything that her family has had to work for to get to the United States. Rose knows that she needs to work hard just like her brother did to gradutate. She does so many things to be accomplished that she doesn't care how stressed out she is. All she wants is a good life for her and her family.
17414	7	0	0	Rose feels wieghed down by everything and trying to help out the family all the time. When her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down she does not answer.
17415	7	1	1	Rose is responsible when it says 'from school she'd gone straight to the restaurent to work a four-hour shitft' this shows he responsibilty and what position she holds in her family.
17416	7	0	0	Rose feels like she is being weighed down and can't help her family. When Rose is asked by momma if she is weighed down and she looks at her and just walks away ignoring her.
17417	7	2	2	In the tory, when Rose said to Anna when paul graduates he will get a good job and help afford to send them to college. This shows a trait of being optimistic. Also, whe talking to her aunt, although she said things probably won't get much better, she stayed on the plus said and said, maybe they will.
17418	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is that she cares about what is right for the family instead of what she wants because when Anna said she doesn't care about money and she wants Papa home, thats being self-centered.  Rose shows the positive side of her father being gone and just accepts it and is willing to keep helping the family.
17419	7	0	0	Rose is unhappy, and supresses her feelings of how she really feels to make others feel better. She doesn't want others to see her as someone who can only take so much. An example of this is when Rose's sister walks into the room she acts as if falling asleep while working on an essay that is important to her is okay. She tells Anna that they need to do this for thier brother, and that in the end he can help them get to where they want to be. She also jokes about money with Anna as if things were alright with money at this time.
17420	7	2	2	The one trait I think that describes rose is, that she is caring. I say this because, when she was talking to her aunt, she wanted to tell her the dream she had. She ended up not telling her aunt beacause she thought it would hurt her.
17421	7	0	0	Rose seems like a very open person. She uses personification when the narrator said, 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.' This just tells you that her and her aunt would talk about it openly.
17422	7	2	2	Rose is caring. Her conversation with Anna shows this. Rose asks Anna if she feels okay.
17423	7	2	2	During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose doesn't tell her how she feels. This shows great responsibility because she knows that it is part of her job to help her brother. She also says that to Anna, that he is the one that can help them get to college.She is willing to sacrifice her time to help her brother achieve his goal of graduating from college.
17424	7	0	0	One trait that can describe rose is respectful because when Aunt Kolab asked her 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family' Rose doesn't say anything because she did not want to hurt her Aunt's feelings or her mothers.

In the conversation Rose has with her Aunt Kolab towards the end of the story her Aunt specifically asks her if she feels weighed down by what she's doing to help her family and Rose doesn't answer.

17431	7	1	1	Rose is a girl who is always putting her family first. Though she fights with her sister and has terrible dreams about the weight put on her shoulders that she explains to her aunt, she still always tries to put her family first. She takes the dreams shes been having and relates them to everyday life in Cambodia and later finds a topic for a state championship essay that would help her family out greatfully.
17432	7	0	0	Rose talks to her sister Anna and they start getting in a argument about there family and money.  Rose doesn't like that her mom works so late and her dad had to move so he could get a better job for his family.  Anna said it helps them a lot because of the money they make, but all Rose wants to do is see her dad and mom more.
17433	7	0	0	She is very brave. It takes alot of courage to write a long essay like that and have to present it at a state competition. She is also brave for talking to her aunt about what is going on.

Rose does not really intend to comfort her sister in their conversation.
17439	7	0	0	She understands how important school is
17442	7	0	0	When Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt tells Rose that now she can tell that Rose is seeing the problems and situations through other eyes. I think what she is saying is that now Rose is seeing life in a new perspective, that now she doesn't just think that their family is having a hard time financially, that now she knows by trying to be a part of the problems and help to resolve them.
17443	7	2	2	One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic. In paragraph 11, Rose is talking to Anna about money and Rose makes the comment that their part is help Paul finish college so he can get a good job and then help them go to college. Their family is having problems and their dad just moved away to have a better paying job and Rose is looking on the bright side and how the outcome will be good if they just don't give up.

17446	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is hardworking. The story shows this when it talks about how most of her days are long when she has to go to school, then the restaurant, then home to help with dinner, and finally to do homework. This relates to her conversation with Aunt Kolab when her Aunt can see how hard she is working and how exhausted she is when Rose comes down in the morning. Her Aunt then askes her is she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help the family.
17447	7	1	1	Rose is very willing to persevere and accompolish her goals.One could seen this in the end when she is talking to Aunt Kolab,   'Rose kept nodding.  Mayber her life would get easier.'

17449	7	1	1	Rose, to me, seems like a very understanding person. She listens to her sister when she is resentfull about there father and mother, and tries to explain it so that she can better understand the situation herself. Rose also shows that she is understanding when her aunt comes to her with more ideas on ways to help out there older brother Paul.
17451	7	1	1	Rose is a very determined person. You can tell this from the story, because she is working hard in the resturant, making dinner for her family at home, and writing an essay to try to get a college scholarship all at the same time. By reading conversations she had with her Aunt Kolab you can tell she is a very determined and hardworking person. Aunt Kolab says , 'Do you feel weighed down by what your doing to help this family?' also shows that Rose is a very determined person.

The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' Rose was trying to tell her sister it was important for their father to go away.
17454	7	2	2	Rose, to me, seems to be a very hard working person. In the story she tells us she has work most days right after school, then help with dinner, and finally do homework. By this point in the story you can already tell she is a busy just trying to please everyone. She doesn't like that she is also so busy but because she is a hard working person, she is making sure she never disapoints her family. She knows they have given so much and continue to work hard so her and her younger sister have an education.
17455	7	0	0	'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.' 'It's only been four months.' This tells me that Rose is a family girl. She is not happy unless her family is with her and supporting her. She is not happy about her dad having to leave for a job in Los Angeles.
17456	7	1	1	She is strong inside, because even under pressure she tries to help her family.
17457	7	2	2	Rose is a harworking young woman who would do most anything to protect her family.  Rose puts aside her life in order to help her brother through school.  She works instead of plays so that her brother can get through school and take care of her rather than the other way around.

17462	7	1	1	Rose is a very responsible girl. She has more of a load on her than most girls her age would. She worries about money, her brother, and her father. Her Aunt Kolab says that what they are doing is normal in Cambodia. This makes Rose feel better and relieves her of some of the stresses that she feels in everyday life.
17463	7	2	2	I think that Rose is a caring person and that is why she always tries to make everyone else feel better. Rose wouldn't tell Aunt Kolab she felt a big weight on her doing everything she had to do because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.
17464	7	2	2	Caring, when she is talking to Anna she does as much as she can to be nice and comfort her about what is happening.

17482	7	1	1	Rose is very considerate. Although she probably resents that her father must get a job in Los Angeles, she understands the greater goal behind his reasoning and tries to explain it to Anna. She knows that all of her family members need to help each other succeed.

17495	7	2	2	Rose is obviously an optomistic person. During her conversation with Anna in the kitchen, she talks about how she thinks her brother will find a good job after college, and then pay for their college. This is a positive view that an optomistic person would have.

This also means that she is not confident in what she does, because she thinks that she can not get her essay done in time and turned in. At the end of the story in paragraph 23 however Rose does get some confidence in her, and thinks of an idea for her essay.

17687	7	1	1	I think that Rose can be described as caring but once it gets to a certain point she just starts to care about herself.
17688	7	1	1	When Anna walks in from her bad dream, Rose is nice to her but than when they get to talking about her mom not being at home and working they start to argue a little.  Like when Rose said, 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' Anna said, 'Money isn't everything.'
17689	7	0	0	Rose is busy.  Rose is always doing something, wheather it is writting an essay, dreaming, taking care of her sister, or talking to her aunt.
17690	7	0	0	It is evident that Rose is stressed based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab, who simply nodded instead of showing a positive attitude when Kolab told her of how normal her feelings are and her hopes.
17691	7	0	0	One trait that identifies Rose is that she likes to make other people happy. With her siste, Anna, she hid how she was feeling weighed down and tried to make her sister feel better. With her Aunt Kolab, she didn't want to tell her the truth because it would hurt her and her mother.
17692	7	0	0	Rose realized she was a stronge person and could get through anything.
17693	7	0	0	Rose is the type of person that is curious, someone that gets to the bottom of things.'Rose felt an urgent need to relaye the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.'
17694	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose would be concern. The morning when her and Anna talked about their dad being gone and all the problems within the family, Rose asked Anna if she was okay and Rose tried to talk to Anna and make her feel better and try to get Anna to believe everything that was happening was happening for a good reason/cause.
17695	7	0	0	One trait is that she is really upset. as stated from the text 'four eyes shining with tears'
17696	7	1	1	She's helpful.

17702	7	2	2	Rose is carimg. I think she is this way because when she is Aunt Kolab she doesn't complain on how she feels about working to help pay her brother through college and how her mom is never home and how she isn't getting her school work done very well because she is tired. She just moves through the day because she has to do this because its her family and she would do anything for them.

17705	7	2	2	Rose is a postive and mature influence on her sister, Anna's life.  Anna feels discouraged and resentful towards how hard she and her family must work to put her older brother Paul through college.

17710	7	2	2	Based on her conversation with Anna, one can deduce that a defining characteristic of Rose is her selflessness. It is evident that she wants nothing more than to help her brother to finish college. She is understanding of the family's position and is doing everything in her power to improve it.

17716	7	0	0	One trrait that Rose has is she's self-centered.  She's self-centered because in a conversation with Anna she hinted her that money is every and in a conversation with Aunt Kolab she wanted her to go to work to make more money.

17719	7	0	0	She is very angry for some reason
17720	7	0	0	NOSYASK TO MANY QUESTIOPNS
17721	7	0	0	When Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab. I think that Rose is just being selfish and just doesn't want to help out with anything. She's basically only thinking about herself. 'Maybe I can sew for the ladies or make special treats and sell them'. Her aunts offer made her feel lighter.
17722	7	0	0	I think that she is faithful, becuase in both conversations she wants to do something to help. In the conversation with anna she wants life to be easier so that they can go to college. Also in the conversation with her aunt she wants to do something to help people see some thing from their country of Cambodia. Things like sewing some things for women from there or make special treats.
17723	7	0	0	She is very devoted to her school work, she won't give up. In the story when Rose is talking to Anna she talks about her essay, then when she talks to Aunt Kolab she talks about her topic for her essay.
17724	7	0	0	That Rose and her aunt both know how Rose feels in their family situation.Rose's aunt asks her 'Do you really feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
17725	7	2	2	One trait is that Rose is a caring person, that loves and respects her aunt. During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose did not expose her dream to her aunt because she did not want to hurt her's or her mother's feelings.
17726	7	0	0	I think Rose felt frustrated or weighed down on by her family. Aunt Kolab mentioned to Rose that her parents and Aunt Kolab went through similar situations in Cambodia.
17727	7	1	1	Based on her conversation with Anna, the reader can conclude that Rose is a strong person. For the sake of her younger sister, she puts on a brave attitude and sincerely assures her sister that all the promblems and conflicts within the family will soon be ressolved. We know that Rose works very hard in everything that she does, mainly for the sake of her family.       In the begining of the story, we read that Rose feels very worried that she won't be able to finish an essay for class, do to the fact that her life is too busy work and and taking care of the family. However, when she is having her conversation with Anna, Rose takes time out of working on her essay and pours two glasses of orange juice for both herself and her sister. This suprised me a lot because of how much she stressed on her essay in the begining of the story. I believe that this little action shows that Rose is a strong and hearfelt person.
17728	7	0	0	She is very wise like in the conversation with Anna as she said that they needed to get their parts so thier brother, Paul, can pay for their colleges.
17729	7	0	0	' Do you feel so wighed down by what you're doing to help  this family?' Rose feels too much pressure on herself. She has bad dreams
17730	7	0	0	Rose is a friendly person. She does not get mad or upset with Anna when she came into her room.
17731	7	1	1	Rose is a very worrisome person. She worries about what her future holds for Anna and herself. She feels that the weight of the family is coming down on her and can't help but to be bothered by the situation that she is in. She feels the her brother will not be able to pull throw and will hurt her and her sisters futures of going to college just as he did. My supporting detail is as she lies in the dark she cups her hands and say's 'Paul's fate lies partly in these.'
17732	7	0	0	Rose is conflicted. She feels like she has too much responsibilty in helping the family, yet feels like she must help.
17733	7	2	2	Caring Rose says 'We have to help paul finish college so he can get a good job.'
17734	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is the way she supresses her true feelings.  She knows that Paul getting a good job and paying for both herself and Anna to go to college is basically impossible, but she wants to believe it's true so she doesn't have to worry so much.  One detail to support this would be the when Rose cupped her hands and though about how hard it must be for Paul to have all of that pressure on his shoulders.
17735	7	0	0	Rose is strong. In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, she is careful because she doesn't want to reveal to her aunt that she is exhausted from working and going to school. Rose fears that tis may dissapoint her aunt and her mother. She feels weighed down from all of her responsibilites and doesn't think that all of this is necessary. But she does this with a good heart.
17736	7	2	2	Rose is dedicated, but feels pinned down. Shes wishes for alone time and free time, but knows she has the duty of helping her family. You know this because she has a part time job and because of what she says to her little sister. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay foe you and me to go to college.' This shows that she feels pressured to help so that she can be helped in return.
17737	7	0	0	Rose has a tendency to not let others know how she is really feeling. An example of this is in paragraph 11, sentence 2 when 'she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.' This shows that Rose is hiding her true emotions so that she can make Anna feel better about their family situation. Instead of voicing her doubts, she laughs in an attempt to brighten the situation.
17738	7	0	0	she is talkative
17739	7	2	2	Rosa was kind to Aunt Kolab when she didn't answer the question.  She didn't want to hurt her aunt.
17740	7	0	0	She believes what she wants to believe. According to the passage, the quote 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college' and then he'll help pay for you and me to go to college. Rose believes this because if she helps Paul finish school then she is putting her foot through the door.
17741	7	0	0	She's a very busy girl and tries to get tasks done. She goes to school then goes straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help her aunt prepare a quick supper. After that she does homework.
17742	7	2	2	One trait about Rose that is gotten from this story is that she cares about her family and loves them. During her conversation with Anna she is constantly trying to make Anna understand what's going on so Anna isn't so angry at everyone in the family. During her conversation with her aunt she is able to explain everything to her aunt, and because her aunt understands she givers her ideas for better jobs that wont weigh so much on Rose. Through these ideas Rose realizes how important family is.
17743	7	1	1	'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'      This statement shows that Rose feels like she is under a lot of pressure but doesn't want to say anything because she will feel guilty for not helping. Aunt Kolab realizes this and tried to help by saying that things were done differently where they grew up in comparison to Rose. This helps Rose a lot because now she knows that someone is there to help because Rose is too young to have to be worrying about helping get money and should be worried about school.
17744	7	1	1	I believe that rose feels tired, but she still wants to help her family. In the story her aunt asked ' Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' I believe she does feel weighed down, but she is a hard worker and that is her trait I am speaking of.
17745	7	0	0	Rose is just do down and depressed with her whole life. The way that she talks and the way that she tells t he events that are going on in the story.

Instead, she decided to take in all the responibilites given to her and do the best with them and that concluded to Rose possibly having a change in her life.
17748	7	2	2	Rose is very considerate to the feelings of others.  When speaking to Rose, she does not tell her that she also feels hopeless about their situation.  She speaks about Paul and how he will eventually come back to help them.

17755	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is maturity. Rose is very mature for her age. Rose gets out of school, goes strait to work for a four hour shift, comes home to help her Aunt with dinner, and then tries to find time to complete all of her homework. Rose does all of these things and is always busy because she wants to help out her family who came to america from Cambodia. Rose also shows her maturity in her conversation with Anna, although Anna says she misses her dad and that money isn't everything while Rose says that they need the money, and they are just doing what is neccisary to support the family and put both of the girls in college.
17756	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is responsiblity. An example from the story is when Anna comes into the kitchen and complains about her and Rose's parents being gone so much and Rose explains to Anna that their parents need to be where they are to help give their brother schooling which will in turn give them an opportunity at schooling. It is also revealed that Anna sees Rose as responsible when she says 'You sound just like Mama', who is a mature and given to seem as a responsible person.
17757	7	2	2	Rose cares about other people because she doesnt want to hurt her Aunt Kolab when she asked 'Do you feel so wieghed down by what you're doing to help this family?' (sentence number 12)

17759	7	2	2	Strong. This is purely in the mentally and emotional sense since there is no evidence given for physical. She is strong because she does not give up no matter how hard it is. She works, goes and most likely excells at school because she is involved with the competition, and also helps support her family.
17760	7	0	0	Rose is very respectful and thinks before she speaks. In the story Rose kept nodding to Aunt Kolab. She did not want to answer Aunt Kolab because if she told the truth, she might hurt her aunt, and her aunt would tell her mom. Instead of saying anything, she just nodded and her aunt already understood.
17761	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is that she has a strong duty and respect for her family. One can see this when she says, ''We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.''
17762	7	0	0	She dont pay attention too anna, and anna dont pay attention too her.
17763	7	0	0	Rose has faith. At the beginning of the story she was almost stressed at the fact that she had to write an essay and hadn't started yet, but then by the end of the story she realized that her family and the way they were doing things is to help each other. Then since she never gave up on the essay all of a sudden the idea came to her of her essay topic.
17764	7	0	0	She feels very stressed about the burden she has on her. She has a job, a three-thousand word essay to do, and a little sister to worry about.
17765	7	0	0	One of the main characteristics that appears in the story is burdened. When she is dreaming of her brother like a stone on top of her in the water, it displays the pressure and the burden that she is plagued with.
17766	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person. One reason she is caring is because in line 19, she didn't want to hurt her family by telling them the truth. The truth was that Rose did feel weighed down by having to help provide for the family.
17767	7	0	0	That Rose see it as she the olny one that matter and don't see it from another person point of view. Rose see it as family is way more important than anything. One thing about her is she get angry to fast and don't sit down and think about things.
17768	7	0	0	A triat of Rose's is that she is a queit person.  In both conversations Rose didn't say much.  In the conversation with her Aunt Kolab, Rose kept nodding, rather than speaking.  This trait has a likely cause and can be related to the situation, showing that the trait can be proven to be true; Rose is has a very stressful and abnormal life at home with her family.

17774	7	2	2	Rose is doing everythimg she can to help her family, because she knows its what her family is expecting of her. She supresses how she feels, because she doesn't want to sound ungrateful, nor does she want to make her family upset.  She hesitates about telling Aunt Kolab that she does feel weighed down by all the heavy responsibility being given to her, because she doesn't want to hurt her aunt, or have her aunt tell her mother. She speaks grimly to herself when she wakes up, almost discouraging herself from doing the essay she has to, but she doesn't agree w/her sister, because she feels it wouldn't be fair and her sister wouldn't understand her.  She is a very honorable, responsible, and helpful daughter, but she needs to learn to stand up for herself before she has so much responsibility that she can't take it all.
17775	7	2	2	Rose is hopeful. When she talked to her Aunt Kolab, it had said 'Maybe her life would get easier.' When they had that talk Rose saw eye to eye with her aunt, and no matter how bad things had been, she had hoped for better days.

It seems like he's been gone for years', Rose attempts to consul her sister by saying, ' It's only been four months... He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here'. Also, Rose is working extremely hard in school and at work to help support her family a sure sign of a desire to protect and help her family.

Although she isn't happy that her father isn't around she is very mature in the sense that she can see her fathers good intentions.

17797	7	1	1	Rose is helpful, because she helps her aunt make dinner.
17798	7	1	1	Based on her conversation with her sister Anna, Rose seems to be quite understanding. When Anna complains to Rose about their father being away Rose takes the time to explain to Anna why it is their father is in that situation. Instead of instantly reverting back to her own interests Rose makes the effort to consider everyone else and absorb the whole situation before talking about it to her sister.
17799	7	1	1	Anna is understanding in what is going on with in  her family and how she plays a part in working through the situation.
17800	7	0	0	In this story an example used to describe what kind of person rose is would be: 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job , Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'(paragraph 11, line 3&4)Reading this and the part of Rose talking about her job and school and home life makes me think Rose is a person that wants to succeed.
17801	7	0	0	She said that she just wonted to be like a fish and beeenin the water all the time. When she was talking to to her Aunt she told her she was just misssing her home country of Combodian.
17802	7	1	1	durring Rose's conversation with Anna she sounds like she feels that she has to understand that her pappa has to be away from home and that she has to look after Anna and help her family.
17804	7	2	2	I would say a good trait to describe Rose would be that she is very caring. An example from the passage would be when Rose professes that 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' I beleive this quote shows Rose's willingness to sacrifice part of her own happiness to help her brother to gain his own happiness in life. Only a truly caring person would make such a sacrifice in their life.
17805	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose, based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is caring.In paragraph 19, Rose supresses her feelings so that she wouldn't hurt her aunt. This is just one example of how Rose is a kind and caring person.

17808	7	0	0	Based on the two conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, you can tell Rose just wants to get rid of a lot of stress in her life. most of the stress is caused by her parents, but her brother is also a contributing stress factor.
17809	7	2	2	Rose is very understanding. We see an example of this in the story during the conversation she had with Anna. She understood that Papa had to work to put Paul through college, while Ana did not seem to be so understanding.
17810	7	0	0	Rose seems to be very stressed and has had a lot of responsibility put on her. After telling Aunt Kolab about her dream, her aunt looked at her and asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
17811	7	2	2	Rose is understanding about everything. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finsh college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17812	7	1	1	Rose is a dedicated person with a kind heart which is obvious to see as she tries to justify her parents actions to Anna and won't risk answering how she truly feels to Aunt Kolab for fear of hurting her. Rose is more concerned with the well-being and feelings of others than her own, and it seems plain as day as you read this story.
17813	7	2	2	She seems like she is overwhelmed. She has to do this essay for a state competition ('When would she sqeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'), help her sister calm down to go back to sleep('I just had another bad dream, Anna says. Rose talks to her until she exits to bed.), she has a job that she is struggling to keep('...and her supervisor was on the verge of firing her.'), a family to help take care of('...straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'), and a lot of expectations to do as her brother did.('She felt too young for so much responsibility...imagining how her brother must feel.')
17814	7	2	2	In the story Rose is a very mature girl.  She realizes the pressure that is on her to make her family succeed.  It shows how mature she is in the story when she explains to her sister the importance of Papa being in Los Angeles.  Rose helps explain things to her younger sister leading her younger sister to say she sounds just like Mama.
17815	7	0	0	She is simalar to her mother.'Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table. 'You sound just like Mama.''
17816	7	0	0	One characteristic that we see of Rose is her sense of realism. When Rose is talking to Anna, she talks to her about helping Paul finish college, toward which Anna feels resentment. Rose talks about money and other worldly things that trouble her.
17817	7	0	0	Rose is very busy and has to much on her hands and she doesn't get enough sleep. Rose goes to school than she goes to work and works a four-hour shift than goes home and cooks dinner for her sister and aunt and has to still finsih her homework.
17818	7	0	0	One of Rose's traits include being always busy.  She always has something that she needs to do.
17819	7	0	0	Rose is very lonely and she feels very sad. Like when she had a convorsation with her aunt she wanted to try something new to make her happier.
17821	7	2	2	Based on Rose's conversation with Anna, you can tell that she cares for her younger sister and the rest of her family. She tries to comfort her sister by gently saying, 'It's only been four months,' when her sister talks about how it seems so long that her father has been gone.
17822	7	0	0	That she is real open but hessitent to to say what she really wants to, because she doesn't want to hurt aunt if she tells the truth.
17823	7	1	1	The one trait I would use to described Rose would be helpful. I believe Rose is helpful because she not only goes to school but she helps support her family. In the story it said that Rose's brain must have surrendered to exhaustion, and it goes on to explain why. Rose had a paper to write but she fell asleep because of the school day she had earlier and the four-hour shift she had worked at the restraunt prior to her coming home.
17824	7	0	0	Rose is a type of person that think s about her furture. She can just picture her brother getting he diloma and makeing her parents pround of him. Knowing that their lives rest in what her brother dose, it makes her think about a lot of stuff.
17825	7	0	0	A trait Rose has is believing. In the passage she is worried at first about her family and isn't sure if things will get better because her mom's never home and her dad doesn't live with them because he got a better job in Los Angeles that pays three times more than his old job when he lived with them. After Rose had a talk with her Aunt Kolab she started believing that she can help make things better and she would do her best to make that happen.
17826	7	2	2	She is really caring and sincere. When talking to her aunt she tried to hold in her feelings about her responsibility in the family so she wouldnt offend her aunt or hurt her feelings.
17827	7	2	2	One trait that Rose possesses is being compasionate towards others.  An example of this is when she is talking with Anna and says, 'Anna, What's wrong?  You feel okay?'
17828	7	2	2	Rose is worried about if she will be able to go to college or not, because it all rests on her brother's shoulders. In the story she talks about paul finishing college and getting a good job to pay for them to go to college.
17829	7	0	0	I believe she could be seen as a patient person. Because in both conversations she listens to anna and her aunt, and then gives her opinion on the issue at hand.
17830	7	1	1	When Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab it showed that she was hard working. That she was tired of all the things she had to do for her family.
17831	7	0	0	Rose was aften discouraged and did not feel positive towards many things, and hurt her loved ones at times.
17832	7	0	0	Rose exemplifies the trait of self doubt. Rose constantly ponders the idea of her life becomming easier but never truly beleives herself. When talking to Aunt Kolab, the author states; ' Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier.' Rose is showing self doubt in this situation by not thinking her life cause become easier and instead thinking her life may become easier.
17833	7	1	1	In the conversation with Anna, Rose shows that she is encouraging and an optomist. She tries to help her sister understand the situation as kindly as possible.  Rose even tries to lighten the situation between Anna and her.  'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.'  This shows that she knows the seriousness of the situation, yet wants to make her sister happier.
17834	7	2	2	Rose never loses hope.  She always, no matter what situation she is going through, is hopeful.  She knows if she pays her dues now and helps get Paul through college, then he will return the favor.
17835	7	2	2	Rose is considerate. She works hard on her school work, and she does her best at her job so she can help her family even at her young age. When Rose is talking to Aunt Kolab she refrains from telling her aunt how she really feels because she doesn't want to hurt her or her family. In paragraph 19, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' She is considerate of her family's feelings and their situation.
17836	7	2	2	assuring, 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and hel'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17837	7	0	0	Rose seems to be the kind of person that, although she knows and feels that she has way to much on her plate, she doesnt show it in a time like when she was talking to Anna. When it would be most important that she kept her cool and assured anna that it was going to be alright.
17838	7	0	0	THhey all have regrets in life about one important thing.
17839	7	1	1	Rose is hopeful.As Rose is listening to Aunt Kolab offering to help, she realizes that her life might get easier, and that a sense of family could surivive through anything.
17840	7	2	2	The conversation between Anna and Rose makes Rose seem like she is hopeful. Rose is stressed right now from having a job, helping her aunt cook, and going to school but in the end she knows her brother will help out when it is her turn. A detail from the story is when Rose tells Anna that Paul will get a good job and he will pay for the both of them when they go to college. Rose knows family is important and she does not give up no matter what the scenario is. This story is an excellent example of being there for your family when they need you.
17841	7	0	0	Rose is able to be helped.     'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'
17842	7	0	0	Rose feels overwhelmed with the burden of responsibility that her family has placed on her. Her dream of Paul's body weighing her down underwater exemplifies this.
17843	7	2	2	Rose is very gentle. She is very gentle because when her sister Anna was talking about how she hated that her father had to go to Los Angeles to work, Rose was trying to talk to her and tell her that the job pays more, and that it is important, and that he was helping them for their futures.
17844	7	2	2	Rosa seems to be a hard-working young woman. Despite how weighed down she felt, she was willing to do whatever she could to support her family. She even got a job and went to school and was struggling to write a very long essay. She said to Anna that they had their part to do to help their brother finish college.
17845	7	2	2	Rose wants to be the big person. She wants to preted to be happy and optimistic but she really doesn't on the inside. This is brought out especially during her dialougue with Aunt Kolab. She doesn't want to tell Aunt Kolab the real situation because she is afraid that she will tell her mother.This is apparent in paragragh 19 when she thought,      'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably        her aunt would tell her mother.'
17846	7	0	0	she go to the high school
17847	7	1	1	Rose is responsible within her family. She cares about her sister Anna when Anna feels disheartened. Also, Rose feels that she needs to help out her family and do all she can to help, even when it is difficult.
17848	7	0	0	Rose seems very selfish when she was talking to Anna and she talkes about money and when Paul finishes college he will get a good job and pay for Anna and hers'. Anna makes a point that money is not everything. It seems like to Rose that it is.
17849	7	2	2	Rose can be described as a hard worker. I think this because of the only line in paragraph seven, 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.
17850	7	0	0	When her sister walked in the room and Rose sead. what's worng? You feel okay?
17851	7	2	2	She is very determined. During her conversation with Anna she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' For a teen, working very hard to put someone else through college is an act that would take a lot of determinition.
17852	7	1	1	Rose is young, but she is also very responsible working to make some extra money for her family even though she doesnt get to do some of the things she would like to.
17853	7	1	1	cares about family, Rose goes from school straight to work a four hour shift before she comes home to so her homework so that she can help support her family.
17855	7	2	2	Rose is caring as you can tell from both of the conversations she had in the story. In neither of the conversations does she want to hurt the other ones feelings so Rose hides her fellings to make sure the other is not hurt.
17856	7	0	0	Rose is curious about her life and if it will ever get easier. A detail I can use to support this theory is that in Paragraph 23, Sentence 2, she worries about her life and the aunt giving her advice that life would get better.
17857	7	2	2	That Rose is a thoughtful girl because she wouldn't tell her aunt something that would hurt her.
17858	7	2	2	Rose has a trait of unselfishness. There is something that is bothering her but she hesitates to share it, in fear that it may hurt the people around her. This trait is evident in paragraph 19 (sentences 1 and 2).
17859	7	1	1	Rose is an over all hard worker, she has a job she takes care of her sister and she has to go to school.
17860	7	2	2	One trait of Rose's is that she is very caring. She asked if her sister was ok when Anna walked into the room rubbing her eyes.
17861	7	1	1	Rose represents herself as a very strong-willed person. Despite the situation that she is in with a geographically distant father and a working mother, she is able to live a busy life. While working and going to school, she maintains the mental health to interact with her family and help them as well. Though she may feel overwhelmed, when Rose speaks to her Aunt Kolab, she quickly regains her positivity, and moves on. This ability to continue under the pressures of a busy life is associated with a strong-willed personality, possessed by Rose.
17862	7	0	0	When she was talking to Anna they was sayin that they hate her work sceduile because it was so late. Then they start talking about there brother Paul, and Rose said somthing about him graduateing from college and that when he does and he gets a good job and saves up money then he will pay for them to go to college as well. Anna got mad at Rose and stormed off.
17863	7	0	0	Rose doesn't care about much of anything else besides herself. In the story Rose just completely ignores her sister after she comes out and says she had a bad dream.
17864	7	0	0	A trait I see in Rose is that she tries her best at trying to keep her life togther while keeping a job and doing a three thousand word essay. She is a very busy but dedicated person. She's a person that likes to take control over the situation but in the end she just seems to become stressed out.
17865	7	2	2	One trait that we can see in Rose is that she doesn't like to hurt people.  This is supported when her aust asks 'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'  She did not answer because she did not want to tell the truth and hurt her aunt.
17866	7	0	0	Rose speakes her mind and tells how she feels about things.
17867	7	0	0	Rose is very upset with her family.  She works all the time for her brother and doesn't get anytime for herself to do school work or hang out with friends.  In paragraph 23 her aunt offers her something that somehow make her feel lighter.
17868	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is her loyalty to her family. In Roses's conversations with Aunt Kolab, Rose shows how much she cares for the family even though it is hard for her to go to school and work both at her job and her home. Rose's dream is an example of this loyalty; even though her brother was sinking, she didn't leave him until she couldn't go on any longer.
17869	7	1	1	Rose is optimistic, even when everything seems to be very hard for everyone.  When she is talking to Anna, she laughs and tries to lighten up the situation and make it seem better, even when it is negatively affecting everyone in the family.
17870	7	1	1	She has patience and lets the problems work out.
17871	7	0	0	If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.

17873	7	0	0	Rosa feels like she has far too much responsibility than she should. Her dream of being weighed down by Paul shows that she thinks that everybody else is free of responsibility, yet she is forced to handle responsibilties nobody else has.
17874	7	0	0	Anna poured two glasses of orange juice and handed one to Rose.
17875	7	2	2	The trait that Rose has is responsability. In her conversation with her sister Anna, Rose brings up money and how it is some of their responsability to help their brother, Paul, finish college.
17876	7	0	0	Rose takes after her mother.
17877	7	0	0	One trait that I think can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is overworked because in the story Aunt Kolab asks Rose, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' I think that quote from the story shows that she is overworked.
17878	7	1	1	A trait that describes Rose is that she is worried about how things are in her family's lives.  She worries about her father being so far from home just for a job.
17879	7	0	0	The conversation they had about the family, Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she was feeling weighed down by what she was doing to help her family. She didn't answer, because she knew if she did Rose would have hurt her aunt and her aunt would probably go tell her mom.
17880	7	1	1	I think she is caring. I believe this because when her little sister comes in all worried she pretty much tells her that everything will be okay.
17881	7	0	0	She is not able to stay focused, 'I fell asleep working on my essay.'
17883	7	0	0	Rose is a bit selfish but a dreamer. When she talks to Aunt Kolab she finally startsto comprihend that lateron her life might get easy and that all along she was just looking for a topic for her book that would show her personality and life style.
17884	7	2	2	Rose is willing to work for her family and do anything for them. For example after she got done talking to her Aunt Kolab she thought to herself, 'Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't.' This shows she is atleast giving it a shot. Also another point that shows that Rose will do anything for her family is when she was talking to her sister, Anna. Anna said, 'Money isn't everything.' Rose said, 'Only if you already have everything.' This shows that Rose is willing to sacrifice what she wants to do, in order to make her family's needs.
17885	7	0	0	she feels like she is running out of time in her life and this essay is really putting her down

17892	7	0	0	Rose is somewhat of an independent when it comes to accomplishing her goals, and holds back on telling others of her problems and hindrences. She prefers too complete these tasks by herself, and has no desire to cause stress on the people around her. This is demonstrated in the sentence, 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.'
17893	7	2	2	I beleive Rose is very caring and understanding 'It's only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could.

It is obvious she is overwhelmed.
17898	7	2	2	A trait that can desciribe Rose would be that she is very sincere. When she was having a conversation with Aunt Kolab, she didn't want to answer the quetion that her aunt asked, which was 'Do you feel weighted down by what you're doing to help this family', because Rose did feel weighted down.

17902	7	2	2	I believe that one of the traits Rose displays is optimism. In paragraph 11 ( sentence 5 ) , Rose says,' Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This shows that she understands the severity of the situation, but chooses to keep her chin up, for her sister and herself.
17903	7	1	1	Rose is hard-working, the story told how she went from school to her job and then home to work some more. She's constantly busy and doesn't complain much, a good trait to acquire.

17908	7	2	2	Rose is a very understanding character in the story because obviously she doesnt like all the work she has to do and how much is getting put on her all at once. However she knows that it is for the good of the family, she knows that by gathering the money needed for Paul to finish college and get a good job he will be able to pay for them to go to college.

This shows that she values others and puts them before her personal interests.
17916	7	2	2	One characteristic that can adequately define Rose's personality would be hard-working. She is willing to devote what seems to be the vast majority of her free time towards helping out her family and setting them up for a more enjoyable future.

17947	7	2	2	One trait that I noticed of Anna was that she is very caring and has a big heart. When she had her dream, her aunt had woken her up, and she wanted to so badly tell someone but she didn't want to tell her aunt because she didn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings. That shows how caring she is and that she has a big heart.

Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' (Paragraph 11)
17952	7	0	0	One triat about Rose is that when she tells about her feelings she doesnt really express them too much. Anna seems the same way, like if she does have alot to say and that she feels a certain way she doesnt express it well. Anna just keeps everything inside, like in paragraph 9-10, when Anna && Rose were having a conversation the topic about their father was that Rose felt he's been gone forever. An that the job he has now in L.A pays really good money than the job he had at home.

17953	7	0	0	She understands and listens to what others have to say. When Anna was talking to her, Rose helped her out. She explained and help Rose understand some things.

She likes to keep her feelings bottled up inside.
17954	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is, overwhelmed. I think Rose is overwhelmed because of the 3,000 word essay that she has to write to help get her brother into college, and also haveing to work a job and help make supper.
17955	7	0	0	One trait of Rose is she is very faithful. She wants her family to be happy even if she is not. You can tell this when she is talking to Anna, telling her that everything will turn out for the best, it will just take some time.
17956	7	0	0	one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab would be that Rose is a very busy girl with very little time on her hands. ' The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. from school she's gone straight to the resturant to work a four hour shift, then go straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.
17957	7	2	2	Rose is caring because when her sister walks in rubbing her eyes, the first thing Rose asks her is if she is alright.
17958	7	2	2	Rose is caring when she talks to other people because when she was talking with her aunt she thinks, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' This shows that she cares about how other people feel.
17959	7	0	0	According to this particular story, Rose is depicted as discouraged. The story explains how Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help her family and Rose had no response, signifying a sense of discourageness or hopelessness.
17960	7	0	0	Rose feels in urgent need to relate to her dreams, but yet she is very exposed to the fact that the truth might hurt. She is starting to relize she needs to see things throught others eyes not just her own.

17966	7	0	0	I think that Rose is stubborn, because when she and her sister were talking, shen got mad and walked out of the kitchen.
17967	7	2	2	She tries to be the mother of the family for her sister Anna. 'Its only been four months.' Rose said as gently as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
17968	7	1	1	In the story, Rose feels that she is having to work on things and can not get them done.  She feels that the weight of the world is resting on her shoulders.  In her second dream when she dreams that she swam through clear, green-tinted water she is struggling to get out from under her brothers weight when he accidentally jumps into the water on top of her.  This symbolizes that she can't get out from the image that her brother has set for her to live up to.  When she talks with her aunt after the dream, she feels that someone understands that she is going through a lot and that she just needs to do what she will to get through it.  One trait in the story that stood out is that she is a hard worker and that she feels that she can't live up to the standards that her brother set for her to accomplish.

17972	7	0	0	Rose had many traits in this story but one that stud out to me was her welling to do everthing. She gos to school, works helps her aunt, and deffends her father about what Anna is saying.
17973	7	0	0	Rose was always determined to write the paper and win the trip. she never really enjoyed the paper but she set her mind to it.
17974	7	1	1	Rose is very determined because when she first talks to Anna she doesn't seem to care about what Rose is trying to accomplish. Then when she talks to Aunt Kolab she knows almost automaticly what she wants to write about thanks to her Aunt forgiving her encouragement.
17975	7	1	1	A trait that describes Rose would be her great helping attitude with her family. After school she would go to the restaurant and work four hour shifts. Then she would go home and help Aunt Kolab with supper for the family. After that she had time to work on her homework. She put the needs of others before the needs of herself.
17976	7	0	0	She was stressed about the competition and how she was going  to enter when she has a job to attend to. She talks about this and the dream she had because she was also conserned if it meant something in her life that has been currently being going on. To support this answer she says, 'Even if i were to win, she thought, I won't get to travle to Sacramento to recieve the prize.'
17977	7	0	0	Anna is a dreamer, not in a sense of sleep, but of ambitions. She's always talking about going other places like the green tinted water in her dream.
17978	7	1	1	Responsible would be a trait to describe Rose. She has a job to pay for Paul's college.
17979	7	0	0	One of Anna's traits is that she is jealous of Paul because he is in college. She gets mad when other people try to stand up for him. One example is this passage is when Rose told Anna that Paul will get a good job after college and even pay for them to go to college, she just rolled her eyes, pushed the chair aways from the table, and told Rose she sounded just like their mom.
17980	7	0	0	Rose is, first of all, stressed out because of the things going on in her life, with school, working a 4 hour shift at a resteraunt, coming home and helping the family with supper, and then homework, and sure enough it'd be time for bed soon after. So during her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, you can  tell she has a stressed out tone, and is very serious about getting the things she needs to get done, done.
17981	7	0	0	She feels her life is hard since she is trying to help the family get through hard times. Aunt Kolab: 'Do you feel so weighd down by what you're doing to help this family?'
17982	7	2	2	Rose is sensitive and cares about others feelings. when Rose was thinking that if she told the tuth about how she was feeling and thinking that she would hurt her aunt's feeling's it shows how she feels about tother's feelings.
17984	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is supportive.  As Rose talks to Anna in this story she keeps telling Anna how everything will work out.  Rose has other thoughts about the situation, but she keeps them to her self to make her younger sister feel better about the situation.  She tells Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'  This shows that Rose, no matter how weighted down she feels, will always give a supportive answer for her sister to make things seem alright.
17985	7	2	2	Rose is mature for her age therefore she can understand the importance of everything that her family is doing. An example from the story would be 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17986	7	0	0	In this short story, Rose is having a conversation with her sister about how she is sad that her Papa has to work somewhere else for money. It states 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her (Rose).' which tells the reader that Rose is trying to hide how tired she is, and the ridiculous amount of responsibility she has for her family. From that aspect of the story, Rose seems like a very brave young girl to work hard for her family.
17987	7	2	2	respectful. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
17988	7	1	1	Rose seems to care more about family then a lot of things. I think that the reason she is having bad dreams is because she stressing so much about her family and the 3 thousand word essay that she has to write and hasn't done yet. But i think that she just had to realize what he most important thing was after all.
17989	7	1	1	She worries about everyone except herself.She feels that she has to take on a big responsibility for her family.

17996	7	2	2	I believe that two obvious traits that Rose possesses is hope and courage. Though she was troubled by how her life had been, upon talking to her Aunt she felt a lighthearted peace within herself. She knew that things may or may not change but she also knew she could make the best of whatever happened.
17997	7	0	0	SHE DOES NOT TELL THE TRUTH TO HER AUNT SO SHE DOES NOT HURT HER.

18006	7	2	2	One treat that can describe Rose would be positivety.  During her conversation with Anna, Rose told her that they have their part to do to help Paul finish college, then he'll get a good job and that he'll pay for Anna and her to go to college.  Even during hard times Rose still told Anna that eventually things would work out and they would get to go to college as well as Paul.
18007	7	0	0	She is busy because she has school, work, and help make dinner. It also says 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'
18009	7	0	0	From hearing her aunt's point of view, Rose not only found her topic for her essay, she felt lighter from her aunt's offer to help her. Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't. But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter. Suddenly, it occurred to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague. Cambodian tradition and sense of family, she realized, could survive an ocean crossing.
18010	7	2	2	Anna is very caring about other people's feelings. In paragraph 19 it reveals Anna didnt want to hurt her Aunt Kolabs feelings. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
18011	7	0	0	Based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, Rose seems to have trouble with internal conflicts.

18016	7	0	0	One trait that I believe can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is calm. I think this is a good trait to describe Rose because while she was talking to her younger sister Anna, she came up with reasons to help her sister understand why her father and mother are out working and not there with them. Another reason is because while her aunt was talking to her, her Aunt was talking about ways to make Rose feel better. As Rose listened to her aunts suggestions, she calmly nodded her head, in agreement to her aunt.
18017	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is stress. Why I say stress is because in the begining she is getting home from having to work all the time. Also she has a long essay to write along with fixing food. With all of this going on its going to cause stress on her which is causing her dreams. Since she realizes this she goes and talks to her aunt even if she wanted to hold it all inside.

She feels weighted down by all she has to do, yet she puts on a smile and attempts to act like she's fine. When Rose and Anna are talking about money, Rose tries to make light of the subject by making a joke and laughing. Although, her laugh sounds fake even to her.
18023	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is with Aunt Kolab, Rose is an American, she doesn't remeber Cambodia, therefore Aunt Kolab has to teach her of Cambodia, with Aunt Kolab deciding to bring a little of Cambodia to America when Aunt Kolab says, 'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. A way better for you.' and 'Maybe I can sew for ladies. Or I could make special treats from our country and sell them.'.

18025	7	0	0	Rose seems dedicated because even during her talk with Aunt Kolab she thinks of something she could use for her essay. In the beggining of the story, it talks about how even though she has so many other things to handle, she still makes time to write her essay.

18031	7	0	0	They both worry.
18032	7	0	0	'Only if you have everything.' Rose always seems negative with no hope.
18033	7	0	0	Rose is misrible, and she knows it; however, she tries not to show it, and wants to stay strong for the sake of the rest of her family.  Aunt Kolab asks Rose, 'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help this family?'  Rose didn't want to answer her aunt out of fear of harming her or her mother.  To Rose, other peoples' feelings matter more.
18034	7	0	0	One trait to describe Rose would be pressured. Rose is constantly busy. Her job, family ,and a three-thousand-word essay are occuping her time. 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal,' Rose's aunt said to Rose near the end of the passage. This detail suggests that Rose's Aunt and parents are used to the pressure that they might not be able to see things through an American girl's eyes.

18038	7	2	2	I think Rose seems to be caring about not just herself, but of her family. In the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling. She cares fro Paul. She also helps out Aunt Kolab.

18053	7	0	0	Rose wants to please the people in her family.  She often held back from expressing her true emotions in order to spare the feelings of the others in her family.  For example, in paragraph 19, Rose held back from telling her Aunt Kolab that she did feel weighted down by helping her family.
18054	7	0	0	I believe that Rose is overwhelmed by having to go to school and work. One example is that her aunt offers to sew for ladies or make special treats from their home country and sell them to bring in some extra money.
18055	7	0	0	In the story, Rose changes the subject when Anna reveals that she had had a bad dream. This shows me that Rose is too concerned about her own problems. Also, Aunt Kolab starts offering to do extra work so that Rose wouldn't have to do as much work, and this also shows to me that she is to concentrated on how busy she is.
18056	7	2	2	SHE DOSEN'T WANT TO HURT HER AUNT'S FEELINGS SO SHE DOESN'T ANWSER HER AUNT. THAT PROVES SHE CARES FOR HER FAMILY AND IS A KIND AND CARING PERSON IT DECRIBES HER.

18061	7	0	0	One tof many traits Rose has is selfishness. Rose knows deep down the troubles and problems she has, most people have also. But Rose makes it seem like she only cares about herself. For example, her sister told her she had a bad dream, and all Rose had to talk about was her essay.
18062	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is hard working, one detail from the story that can support my answer is that she goes strait from school to her job which is a four-hour shift, and then when she gets home from work she goes right to doing her homework.

18064	7	0	0	I think one trait that describes Rose is that she sounds like her mom.  When Anna and her are talking on paragraph 12 ' You sound just like Mama.'
18065	7	0	0	I think Rose tries to help the family out a lot, but being so young and trying to do everything is hard for her. While Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded and fell silent. I think this shows that Rose is young and does a lot for her family/
18066	7	2	2	One trait that can descibe Rose would be that she is opptimistic she keeps thinking everything is going to get easier. In the last paragraph she is thinking maybe my life will get easier.
18067	7	0	0	She doesn't want others to be upset and keeps her bad comments to herself. She is not use to the way they are living because she didn't grow up in Cambodia
18068	7	2	2	A trait that describes Rosa is caring. Not only does she care about school and doing her best, she cares about her family. In the conversation with Anna, Rosa tries to help Anna understand the difficult situation, but also show her that she cares.

18070	7	0	0	That she is very selfish because she thinks that everything needs to help her via the quotations of her saying that it isnt fair that their dad has been gone for 4 months.
18071	7	1	1	Rose wants to help her family no matter the cost. This shows that Rose is an unselfish person, as stated in the story, 'Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought. She felt too young for so much responsibility. Then she shivered, imagining how her brother must feel. Only three years older, he held the fate of two people--both his sisters--in his hands.'

18085	7	2	2	Rose is the type of person that makes the situation seem less difficult by holding her own doubts in from her sister. In a way she is protecting her sister and keeping Anna's hopes up. Her sister probably looks up to Rose so she needs to seem confident, so Anna won't lose confidence. But when talking to her Aunt, she felt comfortable enough to let her true feelings go. Because her Aunt has the role of helping Rose. And Rose helps Anna. And together, they can help each other have faith.

18096	7	1	1	She is  helpful, because in the story it said, ' Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Which make it sound like she is a very helpful person.

18105	7	0	0	Rose is the type of person who doesn't express her thoughts because she fears she will upset someone. In the conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose doesn't answer her aunt when she asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose feels that if she gave an honest answer to Aunt Kolab, her aunt would be hurt.
18106	7	0	0	One trait that Rose described with her conversation with her Aunt Kolab might be that shes actually understood, her Aunt Kolab sees her stress and her fustration. Rose wants to do everything she possibly can but its too much for one person. Shes working at a resturante for four hours after school. Shes going to school. She helps her Aunt Kolab with supper and she finds time to do her homework. Shes feeling a bit stressed with her situation. When her Aunt Kolab realizes that Rose is working really hard and is fustrated with everything, she talks to her to try and understand or see if theirs anything she can do for Rose. The talk helps it shows that Rose is being looked after and that her family can see how hard she is working.

18108	7	0	0	Rose is troublesome, she thinks that she has no time to get everything done.
18110	7	0	0	The first trait that I think of when I read this conversation is how caring Rose is. She has a lot of responsiblilities with her school work and her job. Although she seems very tied up all the time, she still finds the time to ask her sister how she is doing, and try to comfort her with her problems, while also encountering her own. We can tell right away that Anna is very upset, but Rose is acting very mature, and tries to help her in any way so that she will feel a little more relaxed. In conclusion, I feel that Rose was very caring. A person that can endure all of the responsiblilities that she has, and still be as caring as she is shows us one of her greatest traits, caring.
18111	7	0	0	Rose is optomistic. He hopes for the best but doesn't always see it happening. When she talks to Anna, she tells her that things will change after Paul's college is paid off. Yet, she doesn't seem to confident in what she is saying.

When talking to Anna, she stays optimistic about the fact that her father is far away at his job, but he is making more money, and he hasn't been away too long.

18115	7	1	1	rose is a had worker bacuse she has no time to work on her essay.
18116	7	1	1	The one trait about Anna from the story Crossing Over that I would pick is dedication. Anna is very dedicated to her job and helping her family when they are in need of it most.'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shft, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
18117	7	0	0	One of Rose's traits is that she does not like to admit her feelings to others. In her conversation with Anna she acts as though she does not care about how long her father has been gone or how long her mother works.
18118	7	0	0	One identifying trait as to who Rose is that, she is a studious person as describle in the passage.When she first talks to  her sister in the first paragarph,she says 'i feel asleep doing my essay' and that intitles to me that she cares about her school work
18119	7	0	0	The essay she has to write is complicated for her to do. 'I fell asleep working on my essay'

18122	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose based on her conersation with Anna is, that she is sincere and cares about her. I think this because she asks Anna if she is feeling okay, and tells her the truth about why their dad had to go away. And later after Anna left, Rose went in her bedroom to check on her, but Anna had already fell asleep.
18123	7	0	0	She is sad because of her Papa, because he had to go to Los Angeles to work and she doesn't like that.She feels so lonely.She said that the money are not the most important thing in life and she would be happier if Papa was there with her.
18124	7	1	1	Rose is responsible, and she just wants to do good and be a good sister.
18125	7	0	0	I think that rose is a shy girl and doesnt want everyone knowing her business. The essay she has to get done for the state competition is making her feel exhausted and moody.
18126	7	0	0	Shy busy is very busy and doesnt use her time wisely, she needs to plan out when she needs to do stuff.
18127	7	2	2	The trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be helpful. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'

18133	7	2	2	Even though Rose has a lot going on in her life, she still takes the time to be caring for her sister. When Anna has a bad dream, Rose says, ''What's wrong? You feel okay?'' When Anna is feeling down, Rose tries to lighten the situation by saying, ''It's only been four months.'' This clearly shows that Rose is caring.
18134	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose from her conversation with Aunt Kolab would be when she didn't want to tell the truth to her Aunt. Her not telling the truth to her Aunt, shows that she is very conserned on other peoples feelings. She doesn't want to tell the truth and then hurt her Aunts feelings so she remains quiet. She also doesn't want to tell her Aunt because she belives that she will go and tell her mom about what she told her Aunt on how she really feels.

18142	7	2	2	Rose is a very posistive individual. The way that she keeps up a happy appearance when she is talking to her little sister proves this statement. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
18143	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is that she can be very reasurring. An example is when she explains to Anna that their dad was gone for a very important reason and that they have an important part to do to help Paul finish college.
18144	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose would be hardworking. I would use this because thru out the whole story she is working on somthing if it isn't homework it is somthing around the house that she is doing.
18145	7	0	0	Rose is stumped on if she could squeeze in the essay or not, and that if she tries then she'll be even more packed than what she already is with trying to help out her family already. Rose feels like she is doing her best, but that it also might not be enough. She doesn't really want to tell anyone about her problems either because they might make their problems a little bit more worse.     Aunt Kolab said, with a puzzled look, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18146	7	1	1	I would say that Rose is a smart girl. She seem to be a hard worker as well. Going to school then going to work and then making dinner for her family and in between doing homework. The one thing I see in her is that she cares about her family alot. She trys to tell her little sister that in the long run this will help her out. It takes alot to tell someone what they do not want to hear but it shows that you care for them.
18147	7	1	1	Rose tries to do what is best for her family, she always put others in front of herself.ex. 'In the dark Rose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought.'

18153	7	0	0	Rose does not like to burden others with her own problems. She likes to keep to herself and try to help others even though she is hurting inside.
18154	7	1	1	In this story, Rose is a hard worker.  She does everything she can to juggle her life and to try to keep it in order.  Rose was trying to write an essay, take care of her sister, and go to the restaurant and work all at the same time.  She is the type to never give up, to keep doin all that she can to keep her life in check.  Rose was given so much responsibility and it is weighing down on her, but she keeps striving to make things right.
18155	7	0	0	She feels all tied up with life. Trying to do everything she can to stay on track. Staying up late working on school work to get in finished for the next day.
18156	7	2	2	Rose is very caring. She is doing everything she can to make ends meet for her family while she is still very young. She wants to help Paul, her brother, finish college, so when he gets done he will help her and her sister get through college. The passage states, 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18157	7	0	0	She is feeling ashumed becaused she feels that she is depended on to much then a normal teenager should be depened on. She tells Aunt Kolab about the dream that is the exemaple that is being used

18166	7	2	2	Rose is considerate of other people's feelings. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
18167	7	2	2	Rose is not living an easy life. But she is doing what she can to make the best of it. One trait Rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork.      Rose goes to school and has a part-time job. I know from first-hand experience that that is very hard work. Juggling the two is very stressful at times. When Rose explains what her day consisted of, it truely shows that she is a hardworker and is striving to achieve a greater goal.      'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' (paragraph 1) This example shows how busy she is, but it also proves how hard she must be working.
18168	7	0	0	I'm not sure if being depressed is a trait, but I feel like Rose is very stressed out. When her sister tells her that she had a bad dream Rose completely ignore her. I believe that Rose wasn't ignoring her on purpose, but had her mind on a million things, and couldn't focus.
18169	7	2	2	During Rose's conversation with her aunt, the passage says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' I think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone. She feels like it's her duty to help her brother through college, and to protect her aunts feelings. In a lot of ways she has the leadership trait.
18170	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is she is responsible. An example of this is when Rose was talking to her sister Anna. Rose is worried about the family and how they don't have enough money while Anna isn't worried about it because she believes all she needs is family. Rose knows that if they want Paul to graduate college then they are going to need more money. That's Rose's main concern.
18171	7	0	0	Rose feels over-worked and feels like she has to do everything by herself. She feels like she has no time to do anything. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand word essay?' (par.3 sent.1)

18176	7	0	0	she is lonely
18177	7	1	1	Rose is vey independent, she knows what she has to do in order to have the life that she wants, and she will do whatever it takes. When Anna tells her that money isn't everythings, Rosa replies, ' Only if you already have everything. We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
18178	7	0	0	Rose is trustworthy, she listens to what people say and believes that everything will work out in the end. In her conversation with Anna she repeated what her mom said would happen after her brother gets out of college. Showing just how much she trusts them.
18179	7	0	0	The trait that I think Rose on her conversations is she should be more like Anna cause Rose thinks more like Anna and then Rose tries to do her three paragraph eassy.
18180	7	0	0	One trait that could describe Rose based on her conversations with her sister and aunt would be Conflicted.

She tells her sister that she is fine and that nothings wrong but her sister nows better.      When she is talking to her aunt she says nothing to her at all. Her aunt tries to talk to her but nothing. Exept at the end of the conversation she at least nodes at her aunt. She feels very overwelmed.

18192	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is willing to do anything for her family. She has many things going on in her life that she would like to spend more time on, such as writing her essay. The fact that she has to work at the restaurant and come home and help with supper shows that she is doing everything she can to help her family through their problems. Even if that does mean that she cant always do what she wants to.

18194	7	2	2	One trait that I found that could describe Rose is she is a kind person. One example of this is when Rose is talking to her aunt, and her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down by what you are doing to help this family.

Like her aunt says, 'In Cambodia...what we're all doing would be quite normal...Now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes-as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here'.

18229	7	0	0	Anna gets angered really easily. An example of this would be while talking to Rose she tells Anna one thing and she storms off to her room.
18230	7	2	2	Rose can be described as considerate because she is reluctant to tell her Aunt Kolab that she feels very weighed down by her familial obligations because she fears her aunt may be hurt..

18231	7	0	0	Resentful, she is trying to just push away her feelings by hiding how she really feels about her dad going away for his job.
18232	7	0	0	It seems like to me, that she tries her hardest to make light of the situtaion with her and her sister. She made a joke about money, Anna said that money wasn't everything and Rose tried to make a joke and said 'only if you have everything'.
18233	7	1	1	Rose is strong, she manages to comfort Anna instead of giving into the tiredness she feels.

18236	7	0	0	Rose is busy a lot, and does the best she can. I say that because of this quote: 'From school she'd gone staright to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
18237	7	1	1	Rose is a overcaring person. She care for her family and want to help, however the story shows that she is far too concerned and feels as if she must support the entire family by herself.     It is proven to the reader that this is true when she has the nightmare. She envisions the weight of her brother unbearable and she strugles to survive. Ultimately she is drowned when she attempts to tell her brother to get off of her and  water enters her lungs.

18239	7	0	0	I think that Rose worries a lot and that she is afraid of hurting others, and that she is afraid to express her real feelings.

18240	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose would be fighter. She fights to keep a job, and go to school. She fights through being tired to help her aunt with her sister.

18242	7	0	0	Rose is an overachiver because she has to do so many things and yet she still participates in things. She had to do a flawless three-thousand-word essay, if she wins she gets to go to Sacramento to receive the prize. When she was talking to Aunt Kolab it is obvius that the Kolab knows what she is going through and that going on this trip will relax her but at the same time bulid up stress and anxiouty for when they get back.
18243	7	0	0	Scared and troubled, if you ask me. I think she is scared to not able to support her brother are help him. She is troubled, because she is not seeing a way to help she just took it in her hands.

18353	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose based off some of her conversations would be that she misses her father alot. A detail from the story that would help support this is when she is talking to Anna and she says' I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.'

18357	7	0	0	When she was talking to Anna she seemed to be at a stump in her life and that trait that she doesn't have is confidence. Confidence that she knows she can get through it and make things better for herself. I think she is very busy with her life and doesn't have time for herself, or atleast doesn't make time for herself. It seems like she is missing some things in her life that she needs at that point in time. 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years' (Paragraph 9)
18358	7	0	0	That Anna is trying to put stuff in her schedule so she can get them done. But most the problems she is having is that she can't half of them done. So through out this whole story Anna is trying to found a way to do this.

18363	7	0	0	One trait that could describe Rose is that she has alot of flashbacks and emotional problems. Another that could also describe her is determinded because she wants to get this done and she stayes up all night trying to write this three-hundred word essay that she will say and she fell asleep writting it so i find that she is very determind about the situation and the essay that she must write.

18367	7	2	2	Rose is very hard working and caring.  She believes that when you help someone, they will help you in return.  When Rose is having a conversation with her sister, Anna, Rose states, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'       Rose is trying her hardest to pay for all of the expenses that her family has.

18374	7	0	0	Resourceful, Suddenly, it occurred to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague.
18375	7	1	1	I believe that Rose has traits like a mother would have. When she is talking to her sister, anna, Rose takes care of her. rose makes sure she is feeling ok and puts her to bed. when rose is talking to aunt kolab, it shows that she is under a lot of pressure because she has to be the mother figure for anna since their true mother is always out working.
18376	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person because as soon as she saw her sister walking into the kitchen in the middle of the night, she immediately asked if anything was alright.
18377	7	0	0	Guilty would describe Rose because in paragraph 19 Rose was afraid to tell Aunt Kolab because the dosen't want to hurt her aunt and she also thought that her aunt would tell her mother so Rose just kept it to herself.
18378	7	1	1	Rose is a hard worker.  We do not know how old she is but by the description I would say she's in her teens.  Though at a young age, she works a four hour shift then has to go home and help her aunt make supper, and this is all before she has time to do her schoolwork.
18379	7	0	0	Rose wants to please everybody. When she's talking to Anna she talks about how they have to do their job to help their brother, Paul finish college so he can get a good job.
18380	7	0	0	She feels like a burden.' rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier.Maybe it wouldn't'
18381	7	1	1	Rose sounds very responsible. She has a lot of responsibilities and she is still concerned about school work and other important things in her life.
18382	7	0	0	Rose can be described as overwhelmed. She is noted quite a few times through out the story as being overly busy.
18383	7	0	0	She belives that money is everything. She feels that she and everyone else has to pay for her brother. Than, he will get a job and have to pay for his two siters to go to school.
18384	7	1	1	Rose is very hardworking. This is demonstrated by the fact that she works a job in addition to her schoolwork, and also competes in other areas, like the essay-writing contest. Teh fact that she can manage all of those activities at all, even if they do leave her exhausted, is proof of her hardworking character.
18385	7	0	0	There is one trait that can be picked up from the two conversations in the story. Rose wants to help her Mom and her Aunt but she has alot on her mind. For instance when she was talking about writting the essay and she said'when woud she have time to write a flawless three thousand word essay.'
18386	7	0	0	She is willing to heklp her brother work his way to college. She tries her best to do what she can.
18387	7	0	0	the anna told rose head jerked up from her chest.anna, what wrong? you feel okay. that what anna told rose.
18388	7	0	0	Rose is angry. She has to work and school work at the same time and she just can't take it much longer.
18389	7	0	0	Anna knows that no matter how stressful everything is on her, she needs to continue to reassure her sister and let her know that everything will be ok.  When Anna asks about their father, Rose says, 'It's only been four months, He had to go.  The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
18390	7	0	0	confused. I think she wonders why her father would choose to go so far away just for a job and she wonders why her aunt is doing what she's doing to help their family.
18391	7	0	0	I do not know.
18392	7	0	0	Rose seems to not talk a lot, she just nods when her aunt tells her something.
18393	7	1	1	Rose is a very busy person.It said that her aunt' offer had somehow made her feel lighter. It made the weight on her shoulders lighten up a bit.
18395	7	0	0	One trait I can think of would be unsure of herself. She seems to be unsure if she can help out her family like the others. like she questions whether or not she is capable.She feels as though she would be a let down if she was not able to help out. One detail would be when her aunt ask her ' Do you feel so weighed down by waht you're doing to help this family?', she was unable to answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18396	7	0	0	I think that Rose is Open Minded. Because She could be like her sister and be bitter and angery but, even when she talks to her aunt and sister she still concidered about her family because her sister at the table is telling her there's no hope for their family.
18397	7	0	0	With Rose having school, work, chores, and homework I would say that she is strong. Rose has a converstation with Anna talikng about their papa and even though Rose doesnt like the situation any better, she trys to stay positive.
18398	7	0	0	In 'Crossing Over', the author displays Rose as a helpful child, but one who keeps her feelings inside. Although she feels pressured by what she needs to accomplish, she does not complain to others or stop doing what needs to be done. For example, as she was speaking to her sister, she explained how they needed to 'help Paul finish college...and he'll pay for [her] and [Anna] to go to college'(Paragraph 11, sentence 3-4). Not once does Rose express her worry about the situation.
18399	7	1	1	As is widely known, people do not always show their true emotions, for a multitude of resons. Even though her feelings told her otherwise, during her conversation with Anna, Rose still gave her sister a rational explanation concerning their family's situation rather than be thoroughly honest. Then, when speaking to her aunt, Rose felt an apprehension about expressing her true feelings because she believed that perhaps she was being weighed down by her family obligations and that to admit it would hurt her family. What Rose has done, being able to set aside her emotions for a greater purpose, however difficult it is has shown that perseverence is a key part of her character.
18400	7	0	0	Muted noises. Aunt Kolab making muted noises in the kitchen.
18401	7	0	0	Lonely, 'Mama's not home yet, is she. I hate how late she has to work.'
18402	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is jelous of Paul. An example is when she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a ggod job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18403	7	0	0	Rose doesn't want to tell her aunt how she really feels at first, because she doesn't want to hurt her or have her aunt tell her mother. so one trait would ne that she is mature.she takes care of her little sister while her mother works long nights.
18404	7	2	2	Aunt Kolab cares about Anna and she knows when Something is wrong with her. 'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
18405	7	0	0	From reading this story, I have come to find that Rose is a self-centered person. When young Anna came into the kitchen and told Rose that she had had a nightmare, Rose quickly changed the subject to herself by saying, 'I fell asleep working on an essay,' without giving a second thought to how her sister might be feeling.
18406	7	0	0	The trait is that Rose kept an 'Open Mind' during the talks and ultimately found a topic for her essay, which pretty much worked out in the long run.
18407	7	0	0	In both conversations they talk about being flustrated and weighed down with stress. Rosa feels she almost can't go on because of the fact her fathers gone and she's left to work. Rosa feels,' that she is too young for so much responsibility.'
18408	7	2	2	Rose can be optimistic'Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldnt.'
18409	7	2	2	'Anna,' Rose said 'Whats wrong?' You feel okay?' It shows that she is caring
18410	7	1	1	One trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab could be that she is a very family person she wishes to make people happy and try her best to keep the family togather.
18411	7	2	2	Rose is a kind person and she seems to always be thinking about someone else. In her conversation with her little sister Anna, Rose feels overwelmed but she doesn't let her sister know and she even tries to compfort her. When Anna complains about their mother not being home and their father being away, Rose explains to her little sister why things are how they are in a gentle way. This shows compation and caring.
18412	7	0	0	Rose was cautious. She didn't want to make a mistake that could result in someone being mad at her. One passage in the story that would support this conclusion is, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18413	7	2	2	One trait Rose shows is caring. The reader can see this in the 19th  paragraph because Rose doesn't want to tell her Aunt Kolab what she really feels for fear of hurting her feelings.
18414	7	0	0	Rose says Anna 'Sounds just like Mama' she trys to make things work with what they have.
18415	7	0	0	I think that rose should've taken this a little bit more calmer, because the rest of them moved on and so did she.
18416	7	0	0	Rose is a very busy young women.
18417	7	2	2	Rose is very diligent. In the story she is talking to her sister when she tells her that she fell asleep while working on her essay. That shows that she was working hard enough to make her tired.
18418	7	0	0	Rose is a very closed person, she doesn't say much until she really has to or is somewhat forced to.
18419	7	0	0	Rose is very open sighted. She see's things through her eyes and through the eyes of others. One support for this is when she is talking to Aunt Kolab and her aunt says, 'But now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes--as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here. . . . This must be difficut for you. Yes?' This quote shows how Rose's aunt didn't see through other eyes, and had to have Rose point it out to her. The eyes maybe of a different person or a different culture, but she was seeing differently.
18420	7	2	2	Rose can be described as consoling.  In her conversation with Anna, Rose attempts to make sense of the family's load to Anna who is distraught and doesn't quite understand the whole situation.  She justifies their helping Paul with college, by telling her how he'll be able to pay for them  to go to college once he has a job.  Rose also tries to make a quick joke about money to lighten the mood.
18421	7	1	1	Rose cares because in thestory of crossing over she trys to help with the money. but the three thounds-word essay was messing with her.
18422	7	1	1	that she is always worried
18423	7	2	2	One trait is caring. It can be seen when Rose was asks her sister, Anna Whats wrong. This shows she cares about whats upsetting her sister.
18424	7	2	2	Rose, while feeling overwhelmed, tried to be optimistic in most situations. She feels like she has to be a role model for Anna. If Rose expresses her true feelings, then she is afraid that Anna will lose faith in their situation as well. In paragraph 11, Rose explains, with a maternal tone, how her and Anna have to appreciate what Paul is doing for them. He is going to school so he can get a job, and ultimately help pay for the sisters' college funds. Rose tries to point out the importance in helping out Paul. Rose would much rather talk about how she wants to give up, how she is tired of working so much, and how school is constantly weighing down on her. Despite these feelings, Rose tries to remain positive for Anna's sake, and holds her tongue.
18425	7	0	0	Rosa coul be feeling a little hust at the dream she had. She told Anna that 'I'm fine, I just had another bad dream.'
18426	7	0	0	In this story the character of Rose is in a tough situation. Her family is struggling to make money and this puts alot of pressure on her. As a result, when she is talking to her sister Anna you see you get a little angry. This is a result of the high amount of pressure that she is feeling. You can see this when she resonds to Anna saying 'Money isn't everthing' with 'Only if you already have everthing.' This is a rude resonse and is a result of the pressure Rose is feeling to not only finish her essay, but to also make money for her family.
18427	7	0	0	Rose is a very smart person who thinks of things differently than others. This is shown in paragraphs 10 and 11 when Anna says that money isn't everything, and Rose says only if you already have everything. Most people wouldn't think of the situation in that way.
18428	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose is understanding.  When Anna says that 'It seems like he's (Papa) been gone for years' Rose understands it is for their good because ' The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he is making here.'
18429	7	0	0	Rose is trying to be a rock for the family, she has to keep her head up for her little sister, and Paul. It shows when she tries to console her sister by saying 'He had to go.' when she says this she is using an excuse to make her sister feel better.
18430	7	0	0	Rose is a thinker. She analyzes everything and will search for the meaning inside herself.
18431	7	1	1	Rose is a very caring and respectful person. She does many things to help around the house. She does these chores before even doing her homework. She dreams that Paul jumps from a cliff and is weighing her down under the water. Paul in her dream refers to her caring and missing him since he has been gone for four months and him weighing her down refers to all the responsibility that she has at home.
18432	7	0	0	That her mother is always late when getting home from work.
18433	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is the feeling of responsibility. She shows that when she is looking at her hands and says 'Paul's fate lies partly in these'
18434	7	0	0	Rose is timid she shows this in both conversations were she either kept quiet or she didn't speak out very much at all.
18435	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that she is fearful because of the essay and helping her brother. A detail from the story is 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay fro you and me to go to college.'
18436	7	0	0	Rose is very rational. She shows this trait in her conversation with Anna.  She tells Anna the reasoning behind her father's job, and she knows that they just need to do their part to get to a better life.
18437	7	0	0	guilty 'Rosa didn't answer. if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18438	7	0	0	She wants to find something better for her aunt and whole family not just one person. Rose is not a selfish person which makes her trait outgoing.
18439	7	0	0	From paragraph 19 I could tell that Rose is a very modest person. I got the feeling that she doesn't like to bother people. She even says 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' Therefore she clearly does not want to burden anyone.
18440	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is outgoin and is a hard worker even if she is trying to help out a nother family member.  'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18441	7	0	0	Rose is always busy and doesnt feel like she should be doing all that she does at her age. The conversation with Aunt Kolab, she trys to come up with ideas to help Rose with everything she does.
18442	7	0	0	Feeling the family is on her shoulders, as if she is the one holding everybody together. Paul's body sank down on top of Rose, pushing her to the sandy bottom. She was unable to breath because of the pressure she gets from her entire family.
18443	7	0	0	She is very self-sufficient. While conversing with Aunt Kolab, she was very weary about letting her true feeling show. Aunt Kolab thought up the meaning of Rose's dream and asked if Rose felt that way. Of course Rose, not wanting any help or pity, avoided expressing her true emotions.
18444	7	0	0	parragraph 22 sentence 1:maybe we can find a way to do things differentle.she wants to help and is a good person and try that everybody is happy.
18445	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is responsibility.  She takes care of all her problems and situations in the story.  After school everyday she goes straight to work then home to help Aunt Kolab prepare dinner.
18446	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose, based on her conversations with her family is that she is determined. She is exhausted and overwhlemed with all this stuff she is suppose to do, but yet is still determined to make it through because she knows she has to do this for her brother. Even though it isn't easy for her, she knows that in the end it will all pay off. Paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college. One detail from the story to support this is that Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'
18447	7	2	2	Rose is hopeful because during her conversation with Anna, she would say how when Paul gets a good job after college he would pay for her and Anna to go to college too.
18448	7	2	2	Rose seems very caring and always think about others. She is so worried about helping her brother go to college.
18449	7	1	1	Rose is a young girl having to squeeze in time for her school work while she has a job and also a younger sibling to take care of. Even though she had many things to do she still is caring for her family and is willing to do it all for them.
18450	7	0	0	When Rose was having a conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose showed how she can take on respondsiblities as a young women and not complain about  it. Rose took the trait of honesty and was able to confess to her Aunt that wasnt ready to take to on the responsiblities. Rose showed that she didnt want to let her aunt or family down.
18451	7	2	2	One trait of Rose's that was shown in her coversation with Aunt Kolab hit me like a speeding bullet. Respect. Rose has respect for her aunt and her family. She knew the answer to Aunt Kolab's question, but felt that she would hurt her aunt so she decided it was better to say nothing than something wrong.
18452	7	0	0	She was afaird, she was afaird to tell her aunt the truth.
18453	7	0	0	Rose is brave in the sense that she doesn't want her sister to know how she really feels. Rose tries to be strong when she is talking to her sister and laughed a fake laugh. She didn't want her sister to worry about her so Rose was brave.
18454	7	1	1	One trait that discribes Rose is loyalty.  Even with her hectic schedule, Rose is loyal to her family`s needs.  Rose finishes homework late at night so that she can squeeze in work at the restaurant.  Rose feels the weight of a busy schedule, but the extra restaurant work provides her family with some money that they sincerely need.
18455	7	0	0	Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.
18456	7	1	1	Through her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab one trait that shows in Rose is loyalness.  Even though Rose is weighed down by her school life, working, and trying to help out the family, she does all she can to try and get through a tough situation.
18457	7	0	0	Even if I win, I won't get to travel to Sacramento to recieve the prize.
18458	7	0	0	Anna is a very realistic person, and that is a good trait to have. She could easily be mad at her father for leaving her, but she realizes that their family needs the money, so she accepts why he left. Anna can see that her father is not leaving to get away but that he is leaving to help his family have a better life. She demonstraits this trait when she is talking to Rose and Anna says 'Only if you already have everything,' when talking about how important money is. Anna is realistic about how important money really is.
18459	7	1	1	Rose is very dedicated. In the story it tells how she is overwhelmed with work and the essay she wants to write, but she still works so that she can support her brother Paul.
18460	7	2	2	Rose is hardworking, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
18461	7	1	1	That she hard working and does things she might not want to do just to help her family.
18462	7	2	2	That she really cares about other poeples feelings and she showed when she asked her sister what was wrong.
18463	7	0	0	ROSE DIDNT ANSWER
18464	7	0	0	Rose did not want to hurt her family by telling her aunt that she felt weighed down by helping them so much. She did not answer her aunt's question because she knew that the truth would hurt her aunt and her mother.
18465	7	1	1	I believe that one trait about Rose is how dedicated she is to helping her family. In the story she mentions that she goes straight to school, then to work, home to cook dinner with her aunt, then does homework for the rest of the night, so this obviously shows she is doing everything in her power to help her family make it.
18466	7	0	0	One trait that I saw was that she acts different around different family members, for example, she was talking a bit more with her sister than she did with her aunt.
18467	7	0	0	Rose seems like she would be dramatic as certain times. She said. 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.' When in reality he was gone for four months. Which is found in paragraph 9 sentence 1.
18468	7	0	0	She is a very busy, and stressed out girl. An example to show is when she is trying to figure out how to fit in a 3,000 word essay, and work a 4 hour shift at the resturaunt.
18469	7	0	0	Well it was that time in the kitchen that can desribe Rose how she stood and stalked out of the kitchen.
18471	7	1	1	Based on the conversation between Rose and Anna, I believe that Rose is protective. In paragraph 11, Rose 'tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.' It seems like Rose is trying to comfort Anna, without revealing what she truly feels. By covering up her feelings while speaking to Anna, I believe Rose is being protective and trying not to expose Anna to the way she really feels about her Papa's absence.
18472	7	1	1	Rose is an independent person.  She can do things for herself.  She seems to like to appear tough to her family, like she has everything together, and she can get along just fine.  It seems that Rose does not want her family to know of her concerns for the trip she would to take or of her concerns for her brother and the rest of the family.  Rose is also caring deep down, and cares so much the weight of her caring weighs her down.     When Anna spoke to Rose about their brother Paul, Anna seems guarded.  She doesn't want to show her sister how she really feels about the conversation and her family's situation with her father and her brother.

Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for our college.'. The reason I chose this part of the story is because I believe it shows a sympathy towards her sister, and by saying this to her it's allowing her sister to feel better about the situation. Rose would have to be a caring person to express sympathy to her sister.
18531	7	0	0	One trait the Rose has in the story is that she never speaks up for wat she want to say. Like in the storyshe did not talk one bit to Aunt Kolab at all she only nodded.  Rose needs to say wats on her mind or her life will be pushed around.

Rose probably felt aot better after talking to her aunt, and now she feels like things might get easier.
18606	7	1	1	Rose, the main character of this passage seems to be very grounded and down-to-earth. While many people may deem these as pessimistic characteristics, some value these as they are able to bear the hardcomings of reality when it comes time. An example of Rose's groundedness is during her conversation with her little sister. Instead of comforting Anna when she talked about missing thier father, Rose simply told her that it was neccessary for him to leave in order for them to send thier older brother to college.
18607	7	0	0	Rose is open minded. The support is when aunt Kolab was making suggestions like sew for ladies, or even make special treats from their country and sell them, Rose was agreeable when she was nodding her head.

18610	7	2	2	Rose is a very caring person. She would not tell her Aunt Kolab that she felt weighed down by her family because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18611	7	0	0	I think that Rose feels like she has alot of weight on her shoulders and kind of does not know what to do. Like in the story her Aunt said 'This must be difficult for you. Yes?' Rose nodded. that rite there is what tells me that Rose feels responsible..
18612	7	0	0	She feels stressed, like she can't do what she wants to do. She feels as though she must do what is best for the family, therefore hiding the feelings that consume her chest. An example of this would be when she was talking about winning the prize for the eassy, but having to travel to sacramento. She said that she couldn't go because she'd missed too many shifts and she needed her job.
18613	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is tired/ exhausted.' I feel asleep working on my essay' Rose said.

18616	7	1	1	To me, it sounds like Rose helps provide for her family, which tells that she is responsible. When she is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That tells me, she helps her sister and brings in money from her job she spends so much time on, and doesnt have time for herself, such as the essay.
18617	7	0	0	She worries too much about her future instead of what is happening to her right now. She talked to Anna about they had a part to do, so that they could go to college. Aunt Kolab also asked her if she felt weighed down by what she had to do. Rose said that she does worry about it.
18618	7	0	0	she is lonely and dont like having her parents not around. because how she said, 'I hate how late she has to work' and also when she said im so lonesome for Papa'
18619	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rosa based on her converstions with Aunt Kolab is exausted because she has alot on her shoulders between working, school, and other activities such as the three thousand word essay for a competition.
18620	7	0	0	Rose has identified her self as stressed. Durring both conversations, Rose seems to be hiding it. When Rose's aunt began speaking she noticed Rose's face. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
18621	7	1	1	Based on the conversation rose had with anna, i would say that rose is this very sincere person who is just some what lost.the reason i say this is because when she is having this talk with anna she talks about how things are going to be ok for them when its timne for them to go to college because paul is going to help them just as her and anna are doing for him,but she doesnt really know if thats really true.
18622	7	1	1	Rose is a loving, caring and very family orientated.

18625	7	2	2	In the story Crossing Over, the character Rose is very hard working. When Rose is talking to her younger sister Anna she says that she fell asleep working on her essay. Another thing Rose says while talking to her sister is that we have to do our part to help Paul, the older brother, finish college. Later in the story she is talking to her aunt, and her aunt says to her do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family. These example show that Rose is a very hard worker.
18626	7	2	2	She shows compasion whe she was talking to her Aunt Kolab. She knew she would hurt her feelins if she told the truth about her question, so she did not say anything.

18635	7	2	2	Rose is a helpful, kind loving sister. This trait of love can be seen when Rose says 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college'.This statement shows the maturity of Rose that she is willing to sacrafice in order to help her brother. By keeping her brother in school rose knows that he will someday help her through school which also shows that her priorities in life are set right and she wants to learn. Another example of this trait of maturity apears again when the author states that she goes from school to work and then stays up late into the night.

18642	7	0	0	Rose is very humble. At first, Rose dislikes all the responsibility that is put on her. Then she realizes that Paul has the fate of two people in his hands. Rose only has to take care of herself for now. She appreciates the fact that Paul will care for her and her sister.

18646	7	1	1	Rose cares about her family more than anything.
18647	7	0	0	One trait that could easily describe rose would be that she is stressed and somewhat anxious about everything she is doing at the moment and what more she would have to do if her brother wasn't there. I think she feels like she has a lot of weight put on her because of all the other things her family members are doing. Her mom works late and so that must mean that Rose has to watch over her sister a lot which puts kind of a lot of stress on her because she also has to worry about other things going on in her life at the same time.
18648	7	0	0	Rose is a lonely person.
18649	7	2	2	Rose cares for her family, not wanting to answer her aunt so she would not hurt her aunt.  She also tried to calm her sister when she felt bad about her father being away.

18651	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is her driving need to succeed and help her family in any way she can. The fact that she is trying so hard to help her aunt and wanting to keep her little sisters spirits up.
18652	7	0	0	One trait of Rose based on her conversations with Aunt Kolab is that she is tired of being so busy and would like some time to live.

18659	7	0	0	She is easily stressed out to the point where thinking clearlly is near impossible. The dream that she had was symbolic because Paul weighed her down just like stress weighed her thoughts. Also, Paul has recieved his diploma and so she may feel pressured to reach up at education just as he did but the essay unresolved burdens her mind.
18660	7	0	0	Rose is very difiant in the story. It's almost like she is looking for attention. Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose i5t so it would loosen the grip on her, After she had finished, her aunt said with a puzzled look, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
18661	7	2	2	Rose is a very understanding person. She understands that in order to live a life somewhere new, there will be changes that they all will have to make. She knows that they cannot all have everything they want, but in order to have somethings, they have to make some sacrifices.     While Rose is talking with Anna she explains to her that Their father getting a job in Los Angeles was something he had to do for their family. Although none of them like the fact their father is away so much, it is something they all have to learn to accept in order to have the life they want.
18662	7	1	1	Rose is a very responsible person, because she tries to do all that she can to help out her family.  She tries to suppress how she is really feeling inside in order to avoid conflict.
18663	7	0	0	Rose can be described as an unopen person for example in the story she doesnt explain or tell anyone the way she feels about the situation with her family and when she finally told her aunt about how she felt did everything change.
18664	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is a grateful person. When Aunt Kolab offered to sew for ladies or make special treats from their country to sell, Rose felt better. In Crossing Over, it says, 'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.' That signifies that Rose truely did appriciate what Aunt Kolab was willing to do to help her out.
18665	7	0	0	Rose is responsibility, because She said, 'she felt too young for so much respnsibilt'.
18666	7	2	2	One of Rose's main traits in the story is her selfless determination. When she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul pay for college...' she shows how helpful she is to her brother.

18669	7	2	2	One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic. After Anna's bad dream, Rose tries to help Anna see their father moving away as a positive thing. Rose also attempts to help Anna look forward to the future when their older brother finishes college and gets a good job.
18670	7	2	2	One quality to describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be she is responsible. Rose said, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' She has a strong role in the family and she tries to explain their responsibility to her sister. Rose feels pressure from her duties to the family, but she knows the responsibility means more and comes first.
18672	7	1	1	Based on the conversation with Anna, you can tell Rose is sincere. She hid her true feelings in order to try to comfort her little sister.
18673	7	0	0	Rose is careless of others.in her conversation with Anna she was talking as if money were everything, and she was rolling her eyes at Anna.Rose said they have to do their part and help Paul through college, so he will pay for them to go to college when it's their turn to go.

18675	7	2	2	Rose is a responsible person.  She knows that she has a role in her family.  She does everything she needs to do to make her family's plan go smoothly.  She does things that most girls her age do not have to do because she is responsible for her brother going to college.  In a way, she is responsible for her future.  If she helps pay for her brother's college now, he will help pay for hers when it is time.  She never complains and is responsible for her role in the family.
18676	7	2	2	In the passage Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  She says this to her little sister Anna, as she explains to her the improtance of her parents work to make more money.  This statement by Rose expresses her work ethic.  It shows that she is hardworking and that it is important to her, as well as the rest of her family, to work hard to support one another.
18677	7	2	2	I think that Rose is catious of other peoples feelings. She doesnt want to hurt her Aunts feelings by saying yes.'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didnt answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
18678	7	0	0	Anna

18682	7	0	0	Rosa feels like her brother is bringing her down, she also feels like she is responsible for her brother in a way.  A part in the story is when she says 'Paul's fate lies partly in these' , she talking about her hands.  She is saying that she is going to have to work for him so they can have a good life.
18683	7	0	0	Rose's trait in independence has been grounded down into nearly nothing. She doesn't believe she can make it to college on her own because she believes her brother holds the responsibility for that.
18684	7	0	0	Rose is uptight.  This is apparent when she dreams of Paul smashing her and feels weighed down by what she's doing for the family.
18685	7	2	2	Thoughtful. When Aunt Kolab asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose did not answer because she was being considerate and knew that it would hurt Aunt Kolab and her Mother's feelings if she had answered the question. Also, Rose was very gentle about expressing her opinions with Anna about her father working so far away.

18688	7	1	1	Rose understands why her father left because she is more mature than Anna and realistic about thier situation. I know this because when Anna says money isn't everything, she replies saying that it isn't if you already have everything.

18692	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is extremely conscience of other peoples feelings. I think this because when her aunt asked her if she really felt so weighed down Rose hesitated a lot before telling her aunt the truth because she didn't want to hurt her.
18693	7	0	0	Rose seems to be reserved. She's more to herself, she won't talk about her feelings to others. At the end of the story, Aunt Kolab was asking Rose about how she felt about the family. She asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family.' Rose didn't answer to her Aunt Kolab she just simply nodded.

18702	7	1	1	Rose knows she wants something else but the sense of family she feels is stronger.

18708	7	1	1	One trait that Rose possesses is that she is very caring for other people. She is very stressed concerning her family's situation, yet she still manages to keep going. Her talks with Aunt Kolab helped show her that she can take her situation and make use of what she has. Thus, she finds a topic for her essay, making her feel better.
18709	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose would be stressed. In the story she has to work at a resturant, help her aunt with supper, and do homework. The story also tells me that she would have to 'squeeze' in writing a paper. Telling me that she is pushed for time. Showing that she is stressed.
18711	7	0	0	Rosa told her Aunt Kolab about the dream she had and how she felt about it. Her aunt understood completly and trird to help Rose and talk to her about the situation and decided to try little activities to help Rose not feel this way.
18712	7	1	1	I would describe Anna as a very hard worker. She goes to school on a daily basis, after school she then works a four hour shift at a restaurant. When she gets off work Anna rushes home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, and then she does her homework. Anna has to juggle school, work and a demanding home life at a young age which in my eyes makes her a hard worker.
18713	7	0	0	I think Rose's most outstanding trait is her sense of sympathy. Rose seems like a young girl with too much responsibility. But instead of going into how hard her life is, she notes on how much harder Paul's life was. This also shows a good deal of selflessness and respect for others.
18714	7	0	0	What is only one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab? The one and only trait that i think could describe Rose is motivation. I think that this word would describe her the best beacuse she always thinks of other ways to do things. In paragraph 22 line 1'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differntly.....' I also think that this shows her character is a very driven person.
18715	7	0	0	One trait Rose has in this passage was that she said that ''Money isn't everthing'' meaning that no matter how thing turned out they where going to be ok till Papa gets back from his job in Los Angeles.
18716	7	1	1	One of the traits that Rose has based on her conversation with her Aunt Kalob, she's someone that would do anything for anyone just to make thinngs right, and go better. An example of this is that she goes to school, and has a job right after school, leaving her not enough time to do anything she really wants to do for herself. But she wants ans needs to help her family out.
18717	7	2	2	A trait that I believe would describe Rose best would be persistant. Even though she has to work a job, help around the house, and has the pressure on her to go to college, she still goes on with life and does the best she can. During her conversation with Anna, Rose tries to cheer her up and help her understand that they are doing better than they would have been doing in Cambodia. But Rose also hides how she really feels, and even though she does not like the weight she must carry, she still moves on. During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose also sees the brighter side of things in how her Aunt can sell things to help the family out and makes things a little easier for Rose.
18718	7	2	2	One trait of Rose would be that she is hard working. This i so because in the conversation with aunt kolab, she has all these thing to do. It's like she is carrying around the whole family on her shoulder that everything i sup to her. Although she is still young, she still works as hard as she can to do the best for her family, and thats deffeniatly a hard worker.
18719	7	0	0	Rose felt that she did a lot for the family. She felt too stressed. Rose did a lot. she balanced having a job, school, helping take care of her sister and family.  She felt weighed down also.  An example of this was when rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by all she did for her family.  Rose did not answer her because she didn't want her family to feel bad. she thought that her aunt would also tell her mother.  She didnt want anyone to feel bad or get mad at her for anything.  Even at the end of the story Rose's aunt understood where she was coming from and made suggestions to help Rose's stress level.
18720	7	0	0	-she was sincere, one way this is shown in the story is, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'.
18721	7	0	0	Rose has a sense of humor. She says, 'Only if you already have everything,' to express this humor although she does not feel like the happiness behind it is real.
18722	7	0	0	She is very protective of her family. She wants to fix everything and make sure everything works out. She has a strong sense of duty. You can see this by how she goes straight from school, to work a long shift, to help her aunt make dinner.
18723	7	1	1	Rose can be described as selfless. She puts the needs of her family first. She risks her school work and even a state competition by working to help support her family. Her Aunt Kolab hints at it when she asks Rose if she feels weighed down by what she has to do for the family but Rose doesnt respond.
18724	7	1	1	One trait that I can see in Rose is that she is the kind of person who worries about everything like when her and Anna were talking about how little time she had to do things because she had to work and that she had missed a lot of shifts and her supervisor was already about to fire her so she wouldn't be able to travel to Sacramento if she won the essay prize.
18725	7	0	0	Rose can quickly see the better things that can come out of the situations she is living in. This shows that Rose has a good attitude on life and when she is down she can become happy very quickly.
18726	7	1	1	I think Rose is very caring.  It seems like she is doing everything she can to help her family, even though it can be very stressful at times.  I think she loves her family very much and would never stop helping them just because she is feeling overwhelmed.
18727	7	2	2	She is considerate. Paragraph 19- Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would  hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18728	7	1	1	Shes a caring person.
18730	7	2	2	Rose seems like she is a caring and providing member in their family. The storys states that she has a job, tries hard in school, and tries to help her sister as much as she can. It seems the father will be gone for a long period of time, as will the brother one for work and the other for school. So it seems Rose may have to step up and help out.
18731	7	0	0	thinks she knows everything.she ignores anna.
18732	7	0	0	Rose has this trait that seems to show that she keeps her problems to herself to stop her family from worrying about her instead of working to help her brother finish college. Rose shows this when she stops by her mothers bedroom and finds her mom asleep. This shows that Rose would have told her about the dream had her mother been awake, but her mother was not awake to help so Rose continued to keep to herself.
18733	7	2	2	Rose cares very deeply about others. She tries to comfort others and would do anything for them. In her conversation with Anna, Rose sees that her younger sister is upset. Rose tries to comfort Anna and tells her that even though things are tough now, they will get better.
18734	7	1	1	She is hard working,' From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it waws time to do homework.'
18735	7	2	2	Rose is dedicated to her family.  This is proven by her conversation with Anna when she says that she and her father have to work for Paul to go through school.  Also, Rose's dream reflects that she feels the burden of this dedication when she describes that she thinks she is drowning.  All of this evidence supports the idea that Rose is dedicated to helping out her family even though sometimes it can be difficult.
18736	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has that stands out his her love for her family. She is angered by the thought of her dad being gone for four months just to earn more money. This is evident when she says, 'Money isn't everything.' She knows that her dad is trying to get the best for his children, but she would rather have him around. She understands that family is more important than having more money to spend.

19953	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star but he could not read. 'No school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul listened to Mr. Leonard about his past and realized that is was similiar to his present.

19957	8	1	1	The information has an effect on Paul because Paul and Mr. Leonard both have the same problem with reading. Mr. Leonard was helping Paul excel at something, so now Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard. That's how the background information had an effect on both Paul and Mr. Leonard.
19958	8	2	2	As Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard, he is able to see just how much alike the two of them really are. An example would be, Paul cannot read and neither can Mr. Leonard. When he was in college, Mr. Leonard was a star hurdler as a freshman; Paul is starting out to have potential to be a great hurdler. The last statement provides evidence on how similar the two men are. Paul can  sympathsize with Mr. Leonard because they are both not very good at something.
19959	8	0	0	The effect on Paul about Mr. Leonard was that it don't matter how smart you have to play sports, but it's best that you still care for your school!
19960	8	2	2	It shows that even if you cant read, just like Mr. Leonard, it dosent mean that you should stop trying in life. Just like when he went to college but lost his scholarship because he couldn't read, that didnt stop him from breaking records on the field. So it just showed Paul that he shouldn't give up just because something gets hard in life.
19961	8	1	1	He relates to Mr. Leonard. So feels bad for him.
19962	8	0	0	He starts to realize that Mr. Leonard is trying to teach him a life lesson on never giving up because he was a good athelete and ended up not being able to run because he couldn't read. He then realized he needed to learn to read and try his best to achieve his own greatness.

19964	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard isnt a good reader and so he tells paul he broke records in college but he couldnt read that good so it helped paul understand that it is good to learn how to read and over come obsticables
19965	8	2	2	In knowing Mr. Leonard's background information, Paul feels like the two can relate now. After Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his inability to read, Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This statement supports the fact that Paul feels empathy for Mr. Leonard because the two of them have experienced the same struggle in school.
19966	8	2	2	The background information that the reader recieves about Mr. Leonard is that he was a track star through high school and his freshman year in college, but that he didn't know how to read. His grades were terrible and he flunked out of college despite being an incredible runner, it didn't help him academically. One of the best runners in history who broke records had more in common with Paul than he could have ever imagined. Paragraph 45 states, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feeling of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could for him.' Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard also cannot read but took his time out of his day to teach Paul how to excel at something that he did know how to do, and knew how to do it very well. Paul returns this favor to the best of his ability by trying to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. Paragraph 46 says, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, I said, walking back toward the school. It's time to start your training.'
19967	8	2	2	The backrground information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard has a good effect on him.  When he finds out that Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, but did not finish college it gave Paul hope.  He realized why Mr. Leonard was so interested in helping him better himself.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul excel, and feel like he was worth something.  So Paul felt as if he had to give a favor in return.  So he began teaching Mr. Leonard how to read.
19968	8	0	0	He is excited because he will learn how to and be good at a sport
19969	8	0	0	Paul thinks that if he got to know Mr. Leonard then maybe they would have something in common with him.

The emotion in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' After he learns this about Mr. Leonard he realizes he should do something for him in return. ''C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back twoard school. 'It's time to sstart your training.''

19973	8	2	2	The backgroung information made a similar emotional feeling come back to his mind.  This feeling was the way he felt when he was in fromt of other students and wasn't sure of an answer or couldn't read a passage.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me,' supports the my opinion that Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels.  The effect of Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul choose to help Mr. Leonard in reading, just as he had helped Paul overcome the obstacle of jumpin hurdles.  This is shown in this passage from the story, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.  Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
19974	8	1	1	The effection the data has on Paul is a lot. Paul thinks it is amazing that Mr. Leonard has done so much with his sports career.
19975	8	0	0	When Paul gets some background information on Mr. Leonard he finds out that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. He also found out that he broke records. When Paul confronted Mr. Leonard about it Mr. Leonard told him that school was hard for him and he flunked out of college because he couldn't read. Paul remembered that he can read and that he can help him. So that is just what he does about it.
19976	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard has poor reading skills and therfore had to drop out of college. He was an amazing athlete who lost his scholarchip. paul became an amazing athlete  who can't read as well. In paragraphs 4-10 he gets stopped by Mr. Leonard and then trains more and improves during paragraphs 22-26. Paul and Mr.Leonard both have poor reading skills but are great athletes.
19977	8	2	2	The information Paul finds about Mr. Leonard on the website is surprising to him.  He found out that Mr. Leonard also had, and still does, trouble reading.  Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler in college and flunked out of school because he could not read.       Paul finds this to be surprising.  He feels empowered to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read, since Mr. Leonard has helped him learn to jump hurdles and get pass obstacles, like not being able to read very well or at all.
19978	8	2	2	It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard has gone through alot of the same obstacles that Paul has in life.  He emotionally talks about how he had gone to college on a track and field scholarship but flunked out because he couldn't read, and that really affected Paul because he knew that feeling all too well. Paul was having to go to a learning center to read so he knew exactly what Mr. Leonard went through.
19979	8	1	1	At first Paul felt a little big left out because in paragraph 35, he said 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'. After some of the story is revealed, Paul became curious and pressed on in paragraph 40 'Well, what happened after that?'. Then finally in paragraph 46, when the full story is told, Paul felt bad for Mr.Leonard because the two people are very alike.
19982	8	1	1	Paul is surprised by what he finds out about Mr. Leonard. He was kind of shocked and excited about the achivements that he had made.

He now works as a hall monitor. Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard read and Mr. Leonard is going to help Paul run track.
19984	8	2	2	Learning about Mr. Leonard's background information gives Paul a feeling of empathy and thankfulness for his trainer. Paul empathizes with Mr. Leonard because he understands the embarrassment Mr. Leonard feels due to his inability to read since he himself has gone through the same experience. Paul also feels very thankful for the time and effort Mr. Leonard has given to help him.  He shows this thankfulness with his desire to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.

19991	8	2	2	The background information helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard. Neither of them can read and they are both good at sports.
19992	8	2	2	After Paul finds out the background information on Mr.Leonard he is curious on why he is still not an athlete. He is also curious on why he didnt finish college. But just like Paul Mr. Leonard can not read. Paul can feel the emotions that Mr. Leonard is feeling. Paul knew them well because he knew what it felt like to be called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know the answer like everyone else. Just like Mr.Leonard help Paul training in becoming a great fast runner, Paul is taking Mr.Leonard to the center learning center.
19994	8	2	2	The effect it had on paul was to want to help Mr. Leonard with his reading ability.'Soon I realized what I could do for him.'C'mon,Mr. Leonared,'I said, walking back toward school.'It's time to start your training.'

20004	8	0	0	Paul knew nothing about Mr. Leonard before he started having conversations with him. The most Paul knew about him, was that Mr. Leonard was the hall monitor, and that most of the other students obeyed him on a regular basis. When the coach gave Paul the URL and told him to do some research on Mr. Leonard, it had a great effect on him when he did it. He realized that this man was just trying to help him to overcome a 'hurdle' in his life and that he meant well. Mr. Leonard did this, hoping that Paul wouldnt get stuck in the same position he did and that Paul could overcome it while he still had a chance, and the ability to do so.

20008	8	2	2	He finds out that Mr. Leonard is actually a track star, and he also can't read very well. In some ways they are very much alike, because Paul can't read very well either, but he is trained to be a great athlete. By finding out more about Mr. Leonard, Paul is able to compare himself to him in a 'role model' sort of way. Maybe with Mr. Leonard's help Paul will be inclined and encouraged to try and succeed in ways that Mr. Leonard couldn't.
20010	8	2	2	He was suprised that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college and that even though he was a teacher he flunked ou of college.

20023	8	1	1	The background information helps Paul understand why Mr. Leonard wanted to teach him how to jump hurdles and let him pass in the hallway when going to the learning center. Paul also now understands why Mr. Leonard didn't talk about his past and was so adamant to teaching Paul how to jump hurdles.
20024	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past, it changes his view of Mr. Leonard. He realizes that the two of them are more alike than he ever would have imagined. He even says that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings too well, talking about the embarrassment of not being able to read.

'The college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out.'

20101	8	2	2	Paul is a younger version of Mr. Leonard when he was a high school student. He saw that Mr. Leonard achieved by training for the hurdles, but he didn't have enough courage to learn to read. He wanted to become something in life like Mr. Leonard and after the information he found out he decided that school work was very important. He also decided that Mr. Leonard did him a favor, so he will teach him how to read in return.
20102	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's story has a powerful effect on Paul.  It helps him realize that he is not alone in his struggles.  Many people have gone through what he is going through.  They had a lot in common.  Paul knew the feelings and emotions that come from a reading disability.  Paul is actually lucky.  When Mr. Leonard was in school, they didn't have learning centers to help people read.  Paul has been presented with an opportunity that he never received.

The hurdels repersent the obsticals in life and Paul could over come them if he just trye. Paul is trying his very beast to become the beast on the team and at school.
20107	8	1	1	It makes Paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to meet him in the gym at 2:30. It explains why Mr. Leonard cares anything at all about Paul, because he is a school hall monitor.
20109	8	2	2	The effect that the background information had on Paul was shock.  He was suprised to find out that this man that was coaching him was a track star.  Paul was also confused.  He wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.  Paul asked 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'  Paul couldn't believe it.  That is why I think Paul was both shocked and confused.
20110	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard's track career ended because of receiving poor grades, Paul felt sorry for him. He knew Mr. Leonard was a nice man and had gone out of his way to help him, so Paul automatically wanted to return the favor by helping Mr. Leonard in his struggles as well.

This is evident in the story in paragraph 45, where Paul narrated, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul also said in paragraph 45 that 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me...feelings of embarrassment...' Paul was now able to empathize with Mr. Leonard just as Mr. Leonard empathized with him, and an even stronger friendship between them was formed.
20114	8	1	1	Paul was empithetic because he to knew how Mr. Leonard was feeling. 'I knew them well-feelings of embaressment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't konw an answer everyone else knew.'
20115	8	2	2	Learning about Mr. Leonard's past helps Paul in many ways. When he realizes that Mr. Leonard was a successfull hurdeler, he feels proud and surprised that Mr. Leonard would take the time to help Paul succeed. When Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard's struggle to learn, Paul feels a connection with him. He understands how Mr. Lownard felt and after hearing his story, he knows that he wants to do well in school. Before he didn't realize how much not being able to read could effect your future.

20118	8	2	2	The information that Paul recieves from the website the track coach gave him made paul realize something. When Mr. Leonard asked Paul about the learning center Mr. Leonard let paul go after he told him he couldnt read. Now the information that Paul got effected him by making him realize that since he cat read it doesnt mean that he cant be good at other things like sports. Because after Paul gave the information printout to Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard told him that since he couldnt read he had to quite track because he couldnt read and because of his grades in school. And after he was told that Paul realized that Mr. Leonard was just like him in the sense that they both couldnt read and that since Mr. Leonard helped him Paul has to help Mr. leonard learn to read.

20122	8	1	1	The background information about Mr. Leonard has an effect on Paul that made him realize that he could help Mr. Leonard in the same way he helped him. At the end of the story he understood him more after and went on to help him.
20124	8	2	2	Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels, he also has a difficulty reading and he understands how it feels to be embarrased about the lack of reading skills. This brings him closer to Mr. Leonard because he starts to realize they are alike in many ways other than running.
20125	8	2	2	Paul was surprised and when he confronted Mr. Leonard about it wanted to know why he had quit. He pressed for the answer by asking 'Well, what happened after that?'. Mr. Leonard explained that he had been a good runner but had struggled with the school work and lost his scholarship, causing him to flunk our of college. Paul felt he could relate to Mr. Leonard about the familiar feeling at not doing well at school and realized what he could do for him. Telling him 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' as they walked back towards the school. 'It's time to start your training.'. So now they have both learned something from eachother, one was how to work hard and become good at a sport, and then teach one how to read better.
20126	8	2	2	Paul is effected by Mr. Leonard's background information because Mr. Leonard can't read just like Paul and Mr. Leonard could have been a huge track star if he would have focused on his school work in high school. Paul is motivated to work harder on his work at school now because he wants to be somebody.
20127	8	0	0	Paul was worried about his reading dissabilities. Mr. Leonard was pushing paul to be good at track, becuase Mr. Leonard knew that paul would have a better chance then he ever would at succeeding in track and in studies.
20128	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard used to be a good track star, but ended up dropping out because he couldn't read. When Mr. Leonard finds out Paul can't read he helps him get better at hurdles.

20136	8	2	2	Paul became very compassionate after getting information from Mr. Leonard. Paul started to understand how Mr. Leonard feeling about his life so Paul decided to teach him how to read. Also, Paul got some motivations for himself by the story of Mr. Leonard. He found although he is a goodd athletic in hardle, he still have to study very hard. He still should finish his college and get his scholarship. Becasue he learned how study is important for an atheltic from Mr. Leonard's experience. No college would like to have a athletic who does not know how to read. That made Paul want to study harder than before.
20137	8	1	1	The information about Mr. Leonard effects Paul greatly. Paul now has to goals to strive for, hurdles and reading. Mr Leonard's personal feats will push Paul harder and further to reach his goals.
20138	8	1	1	Paul found information on the website Mr. Leonard asked him to look up. He found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good athlete in college. Leonard won a 400 meter hurdles at Nationals, but he couldn't continue on in college because his grades were poor. Leonard didn't want Paul to be like him. He wanted paul to be able to be a reader and a athlete at the same time. So he helped paul train and Paul helped him how to read.
20139	8	2	2	The effect on the information that Paul has received is remarkable information to him. He finds out that the teacher that is willing to help succeed and was doing it with a hurdle, was actually a really good hurdler in school. When Paul takes back the information to ask Mr.Leonard about the article. Paul comes with a grin on his face, that to me seems like hes amazed and feels pretty grateful for someone like Mr.Leonard to come and encourage him to keep trying with the hurdle.
20140	8	0	0	The effect of the background information that Paul gets from Mr. Leonard is Paul now knows that he is not the only one with a hard time. It helps Paul realize that everyone is good at one thing while another may be harder to accomplish.

As it is mentioned in the paragragh, when Paul heard the experience of Mr. Leonard, he felt the same way as he is not a good reader and always feels the embarrassment when answering questions in front of the class. Mr.Leonard's story motivated him and implied the fact that if he doesn't study hard and give it up, it will cause a great pity in his life.   From what has been discussed above, the background information of Mr. Leonard had a positive influence on Paul, motivated him to work hard and made him eager to provide help for Mr. Leonard.
20146	8	0	0	The backgroung information affected Paul by letting him know Mr. Leonard can't read too.  This shows Paul that he can get better and not give up.  It also build his relationship with Mr. Leonard by going to the learning center together.
20147	8	2	2	Paul is amazed. He couldn't believe that he broke records in the 400 meter hurdles in college.
20148	8	2	2	Paul was surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had, at one time, run track. This is evident in paragraph 35 line two when Paul pulls the printout from his pocket and asks, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul also began to relate to Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard told him that he also couldn't read. This fact can be found in paragraph 45 lines 2 through 4 when Paul said, 'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' Finally, Paul felt that he should be kind and help Mr. Leonard learn to read, just as Mr. Leonard had helped him learn to jump hurdles.

20149	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, like himself.

20150	8	2	2	The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul in life, because no one helped Mr. Leonard. Instead of just letting Paul continually struggle through life and not have anyone to help him Mr. Leonard steps up and gives Paul what Mr. Leonard himself never had.
20151	8	2	2	The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard surprises him and it encourages him to help Mr Leonard. It surprises Paul because he asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him that he was a track star. The information also encourages him because at the end of the reading Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20152	8	2	2	He finds out that mr. Leonard is a poor reader and Paul is also a poor reader and it makes him want to try harder.
20154	8	0	0	The background information influences Paul. It is because of the information that he wants to join the track team.
20155	8	1	1	After he found out so much information about Mr.Leonards background it incouraged him to work even harder. He started to believe in himself. He new that he could accomplish anything as long as he put his mind to it. Not only did he believe in himself Mr.Leonard believed in him too.
20156	8	2	2	Paul feels the same Mr. Leonard does,'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had to given the time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.     Paul is really familiar with these and feels that now he can do something for Mr. Leonard too.'C'mon, Mr. leonard,' I said walking back toward school.'It's time to start your training.'' Paul is inspired to help out Mr. leonard so he can properly read even though he flunked college, he is eager to help.It's one of the best things to do is help someone, even if they are 10 or 50 years old they can always learn new tricks.
20157	8	0	0	In this story, the background information about Mr. Leonard, especially at the end, is similar to the situation the narrator was in.  For example, at the end, when Mr. Leonard mentioned that he had failed out of college, which was comparable to the situation the narrator was in because of his inability to read.  Realizing this, Mr. Leonard thinks that by having the narrator do what he did, he can overcome the obstacles, which were similar to the obstacles he had.
20158	8	0	0	The effect that Paul had was consideration more than anything because Mr. Leonard was just a  hallway monitor when he could of been so much more than that. When Paul found out about Mr. Leonard, he wanted to find out why Mr. Leonard 'gave up' on his dream, but he later found out that he flunked out of college. Paul found this out because he look up that URL that the track coach gave him and he asked andpushed the answers to Pauls questions. So he tried to live his dream out on Paul in a way.
20159	8	1	1	The information Paul gets inspires him to keep up the good work. Paul also knows that he needs to keep up his tutoring in order to stay on the team.
20160	8	1	1	He was suprised to discover that he was so good at one point in time and he wanted to know what happened, and why their weren't any other stories.
20161	8	2	2	It makes Paul feel closer to the coach because they both have the same reading problems. Also they are both good hurdelers.
20162	8	0	0	In the baxkgroung ionformation it effects paul majorly because he thought that the teacher was great!! He did not know that he ran track or did any field activities until he recieved that website from a coach.  He was kind of upset about it but he got up and encouraged his teacher to get back on the track.
20163	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard tells Paul, 'The college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work was a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost mt scolarship and fluncked out. no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' I feel that it opeed Pauls eyes and made him think if himslf. I belive that information made Paul think of his future and how him and Mr. Leonard aren't that different. Also, when Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' 'It's time to start your training.' I feel Paul and Mr. Leonard are closer because Mr. Leonard told Paul thoes secret things about him.
20164	8	2	2	It has a very big effect on Paul because, Mr. Leonard went to college to be on the track team and he flunked out because he was not a good student, Paul is also having a problem with his grades because he cannot read very well, so he goes to the remedial reading program twice a week.  And he looks up to Mr. Leonard because he is going through the same thing that he did.      Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because the college scouts told him that there would be tutors at the college that could help him get his grades up, but there were'nt any so he flunked.  Mr. Leonard wanted to show paul that he could do anything that he worked at and kept practicing.
20165	8	2	2	Well Paul dose not know how to read that good. And when he gets on the URL and when he asked Mr. Leonard about it and he says he dose not know how to read. Paul knows how that feels. And then he gose and showes him how to read.
20166	8	0	0	I believe that Paul is changed even more by finding out about Mr. Leonard's college life. It shows Paul that even if you're bad at education you can still be great at other things. It opens up a new world for Paul is what I'm saying overall.

You can tell Paul is more shy that some people by the story telling you that Mr. Leonard is empathetic for him.

20239	8	1	1	he is happy but also sad the Mr. Leonard had to go through the same thing. Happy because he's not the only one that has to go through it. Sad because he knows what its like.

I think that Paul started to think to realize that education is one of the highest things that you can get.

Mr. Leonard couldn't read, so he flunked out of college and was embarrassed about it. This is similiar to Paul's situation. They both are good hurdlers, they couldn't read, and they felt embarrassed about it. So once Paul hears about how Mr. Leonard can't read, he wants to train him to read just like Mr. Leonard trained Paul to be a good hurdler.
20253	8	2	2	The effect it had on Paul was that he didn't understand it, thats why he says to Mr. Leonard 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'

Paul later becomes empethetic when he offers to 'train' Mr. Leonard how to read and when Paul states ' The emotions in Mr. Leonards voice were all to familiar to [Paul].'  When Paul confronts Mr. Leonard, his natural curiosity turns to empathy.
20499	8	1	1	Paul felt bad for Mr. Leonard, and he is teaching him how to read since Mr. Leonard taught him how to hurdle.
20500	8	2	2	When Paul learns about who Mr. Leonard was, that inspires Paul. Paul knows that he is unable to read well but he is able to run well. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was the exact same way back in his high school years. Mr. Leonard accomplish much, by setting national records and being one of the best runner. This is told when the article says, 'You were a college freshmen who won the 400 ,eter hurdles at nationals. You broke records.' (line 38-39). This proves to Paul that even though he is unable to read well, he is still able to be the best at something else i his life.     Mr. Leonard also encourages Paul whenever he tells about how he was unable to complete college because he is unable to read. Mr. Leonards says, 'I lost my scholarship and flunnked out.' (line 47). This statement is important to Paul to because it helpps him realize that he still has to learn to read even if he is a good runner. Paul learns that his running life and scholarship could be lost too if he doesn't learn to read. So this encourages Paul to work hard and learn how to read.
20501	8	2	2	The effects that Mr. Leonards past was on paul was that it reminded paul of himself. He felt the embarrisment When he was called apone to read or when he did not know an awnser every one else new. It all reminded him of Mr. Leanard who was a track star that flunked out of college because he could not read.     Paul then deliberates that because Leanord is helping him at track he will help leanord read.

20503	8	2	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a trackstar in college. Paul soon realized that Mr. Leonard was a superb athlete, but was not the best student. Mr. Leonard tells Paul he flunked out of college. Knowing this, Paul is now motivated to take his grades seriously.
20504	8	2	2	The background information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard motivates him in two ways. It motivates him to work harder on his studies and not repeat the same mistake that Mr. Leonard made in his college days and it also motivates him to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read better. He helps him to read better because of the help Mr. Leonard provided him in the hurdles. This is, in a way, his repayment to Mr. Leonard and it will also help him appreciate school more. The background information helped the Paul understand more about Mr. Leonard, while at the same time, it helped the reader understand the motives behind what Mr. Leonard did.
20505	8	2	2	When Paul goes to the track coach, the coach tells Paul to look up the name 'Grabowski.'  Paul follows directions and finds out about Mr. Leonard's past.  The website tells Paul that Mr. Leonard broke the 400 meter hurdle record as a freshman in college.  When Paul asks Mr. Leonard about this, Mr. Leonard comences to tell Paul that he was a fantastic runner, but a less than average student.  Paul takes this information as an encouragement.  It encourages him to excel in both school and sports.  Mr. Leonard's past also encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard by helping him learn how to read.
20506	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a good athlete when he was younger, but he couldn't read, he was just not a good student much like what Paul seems to be like since he cannot read. So when Mr. Leonard sees him in the hallway over and over again going to his study tables he notices that Paul seems like a motivated kid that wants to do well. So then Mr. Leonard thinks that he should ask Paul to start hurdling, and if he works hard in that just like he does in school, then maybe he can go off to college for hurdling but if he gets good grades he won't flunk out and that will make Mr. Leonard forget about his past a little.
20507	8	2	2	The information concerning Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation. I believe this is because Paul has finally met someone who understands his struggles with reading. After discovering that Mr. Leonard could not read, Paul immediately wanted to help him as Mr. Leonard had helped Paul with the hurdles. Paul saw that not being able to read had damaged Mr. Leonard's life and he felt the need to help Mr. Leonard. Paul shows this by saying 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.' Also, seeing their similarities motivated Paul to better himself in education and with the hurdles. This is the effect which Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul.
20509	8	2	2	The information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard is that he couldn't read in school either, but he broke records. Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about how good of an athlete he was. Paul was also shocked to the discovery that Mr. Leonard couldn't read either.

The coach knew that, so he had Paul do the hurdles so he could show Paul that even though you can't read, you can still do well in other areas, but you should still try your hardest cause life is hard when you can't read well.
20530	8	0	0	The words that Mr. Leonard said were all too familiar to Paul. He felt embarrassment when he got called on in class to read out loud.

20533	8	0	0	The background of Mr. Leonard is something he himslelf wishes he could change. He is dissapointed that he dropped out of college and was force to quit track.

The hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, decides to help Paul by coaching him in hurdling. Paul gets background information about the monitor and is surprised by what he finds. His coach was a freshman at college when he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals, and broke records. The problem was, Mr. Leonard had dropped out of college because he was failing: he couldn't read very well either. Just like Paul, school was too difficult for him and he had to give up what he loved because no other college would accept him. Paul was moved by this, and decided to get Mr. Leonard a tutor so he could reapply to a college and live his dream.

Paul related to Mr. Leonard's failure of college and  the fact he couldn't read because Paul also struggled in it.      The effect it had on Paul was the he was familiar with the feeling.

20566	8	1	1	I believe it gave Paul a sense of respect for Mr. Leonard and courage to continue what he is doing.

20576	8	1	1	When Paul knows about the background information about Mr. Leonard he identifies him self on what he says because Mr. Leonard couldn't read like Paul. But what was different is that the schools before didn't have anything to help students then. What Mr. Leonard is trying to do is to show that he is aforcanet for having a learning center that can help many students know then what they had then.
20577	8	2	2	He could feel what Mr. Leonard was feeling, and he felt as if he needed to help with out with something, just as he helped Paul. So, he was going to teach him how to read.

20580	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past, he is shocked at first. Mr.Leonard used to be a very successful track athlete. However, he didn't have the grades to continue doing well in college and he eventually lost his scholarship.     I think Paul relates to what Mr. Leonard went through so well is because Paul was basically going through the same thing. He had to go the learning lab because he was unable to read. Not only could he not answer the right questions or read in class, but he was extremely embarrassed. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to do anything since he believed that he wasn't that smart.      Mr. Leonard explains that he didn't have the resources when he was a child that Paul has now. All Mr. Leonard had was friends to help him, and unfortunately that didn't help his grades get better. He wants Paul to continue learning and to be succesful since he knows what its like to not be able to read.      Paul is affected greatly by the information he learns because he is going through the same thing. He relates to Mr. Leonard and in the end, that is why he decided that he would help him and get him to read.

20582	8	2	2	The background infortmation effects Paul because it makes him want to work harder. Also, it makes Paul have empathy for Mr. Leonard. For example, at the end when he says 'C'mon , Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.' Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard get back into track because he can tell Mr. Leonard really enjoyed it when he was younger.
20583	8	2	2	It turns out that Mr.Leonard had trouble reading just as Paul did. He flunked out of a collage that he got a track scholarship for. He taught paul how to run track well and when Paul looked up Mr.Leonards information he found that he was just like him. It made Paul feel closer to Mr.Leonard and he helped him read the way he had helped him run track.

Paul became a good athlete and is trying his harderst to learn how to read. There is a connection between them.     When they first met Mr. Leonard knew his own past and found out that Paul could not read. Mr. Leonard wanted Paul to be like him in a way just be better.

20589	8	0	0	The effect of the background information on Mr. Leonard is good and bad information, some good news is that he is a good track coach, but the bad is he fluncked out of school.
20590	8	2	2	The backround information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard effects him in a positive way, because it makes Paul feel like someone else has gone through exactly what he is going through at that moment in time. Mr. Leonard states that he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, because no school wanted a runner who could not read. Paul goes on to say that he knows Mr. Leonard's feelings of embarassment all to well, happening whenever he is called upon to read something aloud, or when he does not know an answer everyone else knows in class.
20591	8	1	1	The story has an effect on Paul because he got the website URL from the high school track coach.

When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard went to college for jumping hurdles but that Mr. Leonard flunked out, it make Paul want to try harder in multiple things.  He wanted to try to get better at hurdles, but he also wanted to finally learn how to read so that he didn't end up like Mr. Leonard.

20614	8	0	0	The details we receive from reading the story show the reader several things about Mr. Leonard.  The first point which is given to us shows us that Mr.Leonard is a strict man.  However we also read that Mr.Leonard has a softer side to him which he does not show when he works as a hall monitor.  However as the story progresses we continue to show that Mr.Leonard cares about what happens to Paul.  At the end of the story we see the reason why Mr. Leonard cares about Paul.  Mr.Leonard does not want what happened to him also happen to Paul, as Mr.Leonard flunked out of college because he could not read just like Paul.
20615	8	2	2	The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard is shocking. Paul had no clue that he was being coached by one of the greatest freshman college runners ever, as we come to find out in paragraph 38. It also gives Paul a way to help Mr. Leonard, becuase Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has troubles reading too. Paul starts training Mr. Leonard after he finds out all the information (paragraph 46), this brings the two closer together as friends, since Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard (paragraph 45).
20616	8	2	2	He finds out Mr.Leonard was alot like him in school and has the same reading probelm.

20625	8	2	2	I think Paul is shocked too find out that Mr. Leonard broke records. He asked questions about it and seemed very interested.
20628	8	2	2	The background information surprised Paul, but also made him curious as to why he did not continue to break records. When Paul found out Mr. Leonard also could not read, Paul knew the embarrassment Mr. Leonard felt so he wanted to help him learn to read.
20630	8	0	0	The background information has more so of a good effect on Paul. From finding out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and couldn't read, probably made Paul feel as if he can do almost anything. It also probably made Paul want to read, because Mr. Leonard said, 'No other college wanted a runner who couldn't read.' So hopefully that put some type of effort into Paul.
20632	8	0	0	Paul cant read and so do to that its hard for him to do his work. So he has bad grades and cant make any school sprots team. But Mr.Leonard could help him
20634	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a great track athelet when he was in college. There was one problem, he also couldn't read. He had broken many records in his college years. He had got kicked out of college becuase he couldn't read. Mr. Leonard had lost all of his scholarships and flucked out. Paul was thinking about that could be him. He was trying to keep this all away from Paul so that he wouldn't start to think that he could also be kicked from school becuase nobody wants a 'runner who cant read'.
20635	8	2	2	Paul knows what its like to not be able to read. So he feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and decides to help him.

He is also inspired to help Mr.Leonard with reading because he had helped Paul with getting into track and wanted to help him back.
20639	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard makes Paul somewhat confused at first, because he does not know why he would hide his past of being a track star. After Mr. Leonard tells Paul the whole story, Paul is empathetic with Mr. Leonard's situation because he is in a similar situation, and decides to help him with his past.
20640	8	2	2	Paul feels like he is in Mr. Leonard's shoes when he was younger. In the story Paul states,'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This gave Paul motivation to achieve something for not only himself but Mr. Leonard who was not able to achieve much in school.
20641	8	2	2	Paul is very thankful towards Mr. Leonard for helping him get faster. Paul says in the passage, 'It's time to start your training.' this is a way that paul can help Mr. leonard on his reading and to repay him for what he done for him. the background information helps paul realize that not everyone is the same, and that he isn't the only person that can't read. Mr. Leonard gave paul some confidence.
20642	8	2	2	When Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in high school and in college but did poorly academicly it encouraged him to try his best. Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was one of the best hurdlers, but when he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read no other school wanted him, even though he was one of the best. This showed Paul that even though you could be one of the best at a sport it doesn't matter if you don't have the grades.
20643	8	1	1	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was great for Paul and Mr. Leonard.  Paul realized that he could do something he never thought of doing with the help of Mr. Leonard.  Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard, just like Mr. Leonard helped him.
20645	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard hands Paul the URL, and Paul looks him up, he realizes something important. Mr. Leonard and Paul had something in common. They both struggled with reading. Mr. Leonard saw an opportunity to help Paul achieve his goals, and he took that opportunity.     Obviously, when Mr. Leonard looked at Paul, he saw himself as a child. He remembered what it was like to be in his position. So, Paul was blessed to have someone like him to help. Paul realizes that just because he is chosen last for teams, and he is unable to read, doesn't mean he is unable to do other important things. Mr. Leonard proudly accepts the opportunity to help Paul so he could achieve his dreams.
20646	8	0	0	THAT MR. LEONARD WANT TO COLLEGE AND RUN TRACK AND FIELD AND THAT HE SHOULD COACH IT.
20647	8	2	2	When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a runner also he is very surprised. Paul first wants to know why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about it. 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul knows exactly what Mr. Leonard went through because he is going through the same thing. Paul knows exactly how it feels to be embarrassed because he can't read. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me.' Paul feels bad for Mr. Leonard and wants to help him.
20648	8	0	0	After Mr. leonard helps paul become a great runner he went and talked to the rack coach. He soon found out that Mr. leonard was an amazing runner and even got a scholarship for it. the effect of learning Mr. Leonard was a great runner was that he really knew what he was doing and taught paul very well. Paul also learned that without education its hard to keep your dreams alive. If Mr. Leonard would have known to read he could have made even more records to beat.
20649	8	2	2	While training with Mr. Leonard, Paul learns more about him and his past. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is not just a hall monitor, in fact Mr. Leonard was a track star who broke records and recieved a college scholorship.

20655	8	2	2	The background information presented about Mr. Leonard is effective in the fact that Paul can realize his own true potential.      In the story, Paul not only learns about Mr. Leonard's past as a track 'star', but also about his stuggles with learning. This information motivates Paul because he realizes that he has more opprotunities than Mr. Leonard ever did and that even though Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, his school work was more important; grades really do matter.      This information also helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard and him share a connection. Through this connection, they can both help each other out.

20664	8	2	2	When Paul is told to look up Mr. Leonard, he finds out that he was a track star and was a college freshmen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  Paul also finds out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college and lost his scholarship because he couldn't read.  Paul sees that he's not alone and can relate to someone about not being able to read.

20674	8	2	2	When Paul found out Mr. Leonard was a track star and a good athlete in college, but lost his scholarship because he was not a good student, Paul started to relate to Mr. Leornard. He felt like they had the same flaws and problems. Mr. Leonard helped Paul excel in track and jumping hurdles, and Paul felt as if it was only fair if he helped Mr. Leonard to read because Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed to read aloud in front of people.
20675	8	0	0	He feels sorry for Paul for having struggles with reading because My. Leanard knows exactly how it felt to succeed so well at something but in the same aspect he was not a good student and no school wanted an athlete who could not read.

Then when the track coach tells him to search the hall monitor on a track and feild website he finds out that Mr. Leonard was a running star when he was young and also by asking Mr. Leonard he finds out that he cannot read just like Paul. It gives Paul a whole new perspective on Mr. Leonard because he then understands that the reason Mr. Leonard is helping him is that he was just like Paul at that age and he can relate to him.
20679	8	0	0	The background information had a negative effect on Paul. Paul saw that he was an amazing track runner, but now he's just a hall monitor. What happened to his big chance in a good carer? So it kinda gave Paul a loss in hope for sucess.
20681	8	1	1	The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard make him feel closer to him as a person. He understands his feelings and he understands his past because he has been through things similar to what Mr. Leonard has experienced.
20682	8	2	2	The highschool trach coach handed Paul a URL for the internet to visit.  Paul printed out the page from the internet and handed it to Mr. Leonard.  The URL happened to be about Mr. Leonard's past.  He happened to be a record breaking track star as a freshman, but then he flunked out of college.  This forms a unique bond between Paul and Mr. Leonard because they both struggle with school and reading.  At the end, Paul says, 'It's time to start your training'(paragraph 46).  This shows that Paul is grateful for Mr. Leonard coaching him and bringing joy to an area of his life he had yet to feel.  In return, Paul is willing to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20683	8	0	0	He found out that Mr. Lenoard is not doing well in some things. He did not go to college thinking that he would flunk it so that is the reason why.
20684	8	2	2	The coach gives Paul a website to go to. On the website he finds out about Mr.leonard being a college runner in the 400 meter hurdles. The next day he goes to the hall moniter and ask why he never went anywhere pulling out the print off. He simply replied in sorrow he couldnt read. This inspired paul knowing that Mr. leonard took the time out of his day to help him that's why paul is hepling him learn to read.
20685	8	2	2	The first information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard is that he is a hall monitor whose job it is to keep things moving. The effect of this information is that when Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track, Paul obeys because that is what he is used to doing when Mr. Leonard tells him to do something. Later, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star while he was a freshman in college, and that his career came to a halt due to the fact that he was not a talented reader. Paul's learning of this new information ignites empathy in him and makes him feel like he and Mr. Leonard are not all that different. Paul is getting better at reading by visiting the learning center, and it is implied that he would like to give this same gift to Mr. Leonard. Paul's newfound knowledge of Mr.Leonard's background evokes this generosity.
20686	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him.  They both can't read but are willing to try and get better at anything.  At the end of the story, Paul tells Mr. Leonard, 'It's time to start your training.'

In the story, Paul is confused when Mr. Leonard asks his name after seeing all the hall passes. But after he finds out that he can't read, he wants to start training Mr. Leonard so that he can appreciate what he had done for Paul during the track season.
20694	8	0	0	It makes Paul curious. You can tell this because he asks Mr. Leonard why he he had not ever mentioned it to him. Another reason you can tell it makes him curious is because Paul asks other questions about Mr.Leonards past like 'What Happened.'

20698	8	1	1	Before Paul knew of Mr. Leonards disability he had just thought of him as some one who didnt know what they were talking about. That Mr. Leonard didnt really understand who Paul was and didnt understnd Pauls' disabilities.            After reading the passage Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had full empathy for him and uunderstood Paul to the fullest. Mr. Leonard then had a bigger empact on Paul because now Paul sees what he can become,and what he has to do to become whatver it is that he wants.

20704	8	2	2	Paul finds reading hard; so does Mr. Leonard. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star, but couldn't read, this reminded him that he couldn't read. If Mr. Leonard could read, but can be a track star, then Paul can work on his reading and become a track star. Mr. Leonard's history shows Pail what he can become.
20706	8	1	1	When Paul got background information on Mr. Leonard that effected Paul to, feel like he isn;t the only one that has a reading problem at school and couldnt read that well. And it also made him feel just like Mr. Leonard, because he was always pick lasted for a team so he also started training and got really good at sports so he wasnt chosed last anymore.

When Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his past, it shows a connection between the two and shows Paul that he can be successful in life.
20708	8	2	2	Paul is very shocked by what he see's on the internet about Mr. Leonard. It also encourages Paul to good in track and in school now, because he has seen what happened to Mr. Leonard by not being able to read.
20709	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard effects Paul by helping Paul recognize that Mr. Leonard never learned well and he needed Learning Centers. Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but he was never an exceptional learner, through this, Paul gained the need to help Mr. Leonard learn.

When Paul ran into Mr.Leonard in the hallway he asked for his pass and asked were he was going, Paul told Mr.Leonard he was going to learn to read because he couldnt. Mr.Leonard eased up and let him go through as if he knew what he was talking about. Now Mr.Leonard is their track couch and Paul is very good now just like Mr.Leonard was.
20713	8	0	0	That Mr. Leonard was a Collage track super star and he broke records. It had a negative and a postive effect on Paul. It put him down that the man who had been helping him had not told him that he was a track star, but it also helped him when he confronted Mr. Leonard about it.
20714	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard told him about is college days paul wanted him to coach and train him, because he was a good coach to him. Paul felt the same when Mr. Leaonard told him about is past about no being able to read, so paul wanted to work hard to know how to read so he could go to college and run track.
20715	8	0	0	It makes Paul seem more able to read by using an adult who has trouble reading as another example. It also makes paul feel less inferior to Mr. Leonard. At the end of the story Paul makes a statement that begins the idea that Paul then helps Mr. Leonard with reading.
20716	8	0	0	It show Paul that people aare like him so there is more than a select few. It can be Paul being just like Mr. Leonard so if he becomes a better reader he can go on to college and do great things.
20717	8	1	1	I believe that the background information Paul receives effects Paul in such a way that he feels inspired, encouraged and feels like the sky is his limit.
20718	8	2	2	After Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a major track star in college along with finding out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he could not read, this inspired Paul to help Mr. Leonard. After Paul and Mr. Leonard talked about Mr. Leonards college accomplishments, Paul thought of an idea. Paul was going to go help teach Mr. Leonard how to read since Mr. Leonard helped Paul with running track and becoming faster and more athletic.
20719	8	2	2	When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a champ track runner in his college days his becomes curious as to why he would quit if he had goen as far as setting records. He soon finds out that Mr. Leonard also could not read, just like Paul.

20723	8	2	2	In the story our narrator Paul finds some background information on Mr. Leaonard. This information impacts Paul greatly in the story. His attitude and the way he sees things change completely.     When Paul had said 'I knew the well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read alouf or when I didn't know an answer everone else knew.' Paul understands how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing what it was like to not be the best student in the world and having to get help from people. Paul feels for Mr. Leonard and he sympathizes for him.     Pauls attitude changes dramatically when he says 'It's time to start your training.'. Now the Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can not read he wants to help him out to repay him for helping him find his secret talant.
20726	8	2	2	The background information effects Paul because it makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. When Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard was a track star during college, by the URL given to him by the track coach, he acts suprised and decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20727	8	1	1	Paul most likely now understands why Mr. Leonard is encouraging him to do the races, and wants him to go to college and graduate.
20728	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a star track runner and a horrible reader too.
20729	8	2	2	The background information about Mr.Leonard effects Paul by showing him and inspiring him with a story that is somewhat similar to his own. He knows that Mr.Leonard and himself have things incommon. They are both very bad readers and are good at running hurdles.
20730	8	1	1	Paul understood better why Mr. Leonard took care of Paul. When Paul told Mr. Leonard he couldn't read, that was a sign right there that he was going to look after him and make him a star. With this back ground information, Paul felt more emotionally connected to Mr. Leonard because he went through the exact same things in his life. He felt like there was someone else out there, and this man was just trying to help Paul succeed at something.
20731	8	1	1	The background information has a big effect on Paul. It motivates Paul to do even better, since him and Mr. Leonard had similar problems in school.
20732	8	1	1	The background information that Mr. Leonard has on paul would make him feel sometype of sympathy for him. It would make him work harder and do better to get paul on track.
20733	8	2	2	The effect that background information has on Paul is that he now feels connected to Mr. Leonard because they both went through the same thing in not being able to read very good. Paul knows exactly what it felt like to not be able to read.
20735	8	2	2	Paul feels sympathetic for Mr. Leonard when he finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read. I suspect that this is because Paul could not read very well. Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me.

It surprises Paul and also lets him know Mr. Leonard was a good runner. Also it inspires Paul to continue track and even become an even better athelete.
20865	8	2	2	Paul is surprised about the background information.  He was surprised he won 400 meters at nationals and broke the records.  He wants to know more about him.
20868	8	2	2	I think this affected Paul becuase he thought he was just a gym teacher. Little did Paul know, but Mr. Leonard was a start track runner. This background information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him. This also makes him want to help with his reading problems. At the end of the story Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20869	8	2	2	The effect it has on paul is he has a better understanding of Mr. Leonard because he finds out he can't read either so he can understand how Mr. Leonard feels.
20870	8	2	2	Paul feels like since Mr. Lenard has helped him become a track and field runner, he should help Mr. Lenard learn how to read. Paul does this by saying that Mr. Lenard has some training to do. Paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on Mr. Lenard. He was also empathetic for Mr. Lenard. He wanted to help Mr. Lenard like Mr. Lenard helped him.
20871	8	2	2	Paul related better to Mr. Leonard after he found out that Mr. Leonard wasn't very good at reading either.
20872	8	2	2	The backround story you get on Mr. Leonard is that he was a good athlete, but he was not a good student. College scouts told Mr. Leonard that his grades didn't matter and that they would have tutors for him. But since he never did his own work and always had his friends help him during high school, he could not handle the more difficult college work. This caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship.      Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard's emotions because he too, had difficulties wtih school work. At the end of the stroy, Paul tells Mr. Leonard its time for him to start his training. This implys that since Mr. Leonard has helped Paul with his running, that Paul will help Mr. Leonard to learn to read.
20873	8	1	1	the effect that the background of Mr. Leonard has on paul is the they are almost alike.
20874	8	2	2	Paul is affected by the background information because he is able to empathize with Mr. Leonard about reading difficulties. He also most likely understands that, had he been born in an earlier age, he may have had the same college experience as Mr. Leonard. Paul is also influenced by the background information to help Mr. Leonard 'train' in reading, which is Paul's way of showing gratitude and appreciation for Mr. Leonard's efforts to train Paul in track and field.
20875	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background information had a large effect on Paul. Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals but flunked out of college because he could not read, and the school work was too challenging. No school would take a runner who couldn't read. After Paul learned all of this information, he felt empathy for Mr. Leonard. Paul had walked in his shoes somewhat. He knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or did not know an answer. Paul was very grateful and shocked that Mr. Leonard gave up his time to help Paul succeed, and he wants to repay him now for all his help and dedication.
20876	8	1	1	that anyone can be good at something but sometimes a little trouble can ruin everything just speaking about mr. leonards grades he was a good runner just not a good student paul is oustanded by it so it encourages him to do good in school and on the track to show Mr. Leonard he can do it
20877	8	0	0	The effect it had on Paul was that basically he could be a great athlete but he would have to have his grades right also.He was a college freshmen who won the 40 meter hurdkes at nationals, but he couldnt read.
20878	8	2	2	Learning that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading as well my Paul feel less alone in the fact he has trouble with reading and schol. Before he felt stupid when he was called on to read in class or to answer a question he didn't know the answer to and everyone else did. Now he realizes he isn't alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident.
20879	8	1	1	Paul was shocked. He did not know what to think.
20880	8	2	2	When he learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star, Paul is slightly unhappy that he wasn't told. He even asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell Paul. He then feels like Mr. Leonard is a kindred spirit when he says 'the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' He feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and that makes Paul want to help him at the end of the story.
20881	8	2	2	At first,he admires Mr.Leonard. He saw that he had been a very talented athlete and he wonders why he never told him about it. When Paul finds out Mr. Leonard can't read, he becomes sympathetic and wants to help him just as Mr. Leonard helped Paul with the hurldes.
20882	8	1	1	The effect of Mr. Leonard's background on Paul is great.  Paul can connect himself to Mr. Leonard because their backgrounds are similar.
20883	8	2	2	Finding out about Mr. Leonard's past helps Paul in realizing that he can do things he didn't know he could do. Seeing what happened to Mr. Leonard helped Paul fight through challenges. In the end, Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'
20885	8	2	2	The effect it has on Paul, is that he's going throught the same things as Mr. Leonard went through. For example, when Mr. Leonard was in high school he could read either, and he relied on his friends for the work that was givin. But as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability. Paul refers to this because he can't read either. All in all, Mr. Leonard, wants Paul to succeed unlike he did. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to do his best and do better then he did.
20886	8	1	1	Paul begins to feel bad for Mr. Leonard and sees that they are similar and so many different ways. They both are not the best at reading but they both try to become better at it, just as they try to become better athletes.
20887	8	0	0	Paul finds background information on Mr. Leonard from the website. Paul pulled the printout of Mr. Leonard when he used to run. Mr. Leonard then smiled sadly. The effect makes the reader wonder why Mr. Leonard is sad, and makes Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about this before.
20889	8	1	1	Paul feels sorry for Mr. Leonard, because he understands and can relate to how he feels. Mr. Leonard's past of 'feelings of embarrassment,' were Paul's present life.
20890	8	0	0	Paul was a guy who felt neglected and was always picked last and Mr. Leonard picked up on it.  He knows what it is like to feel embarrassed to not be able to do something because he flunked out of college.  He motivated Paul to do hurdles and showed him how they are obstacles in life. He also found that he was not good at reading either so he was concerned and wanted to help.
20891	8	0	0	The stouy was about paul whns to be the beast.
20892	8	0	0	The effect after Paul figured out about Mr. Leonard's past was really good for him because Mr. Leonard had the same probolems with reading and his grades but back then it didnt matter what your grades were. It was showing Paul that if he put his mind to it and tried hard he could acomplish anything he set his mind to.
20893	8	2	2	Paul is amazed at the achievments of Mr. Leonard and is curious as to why he did not pursue his talent. In line 40, Paul asks 'Well, what happened after that.' This shows that, at the time, Paul didnt understand why Mr. Leonard didn't pursue track and field. Afterwards, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is illiterate. He becomes empathetic because he sees they share the same struggle.
20894	8	2	2	The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard had on Paul was he wanted to help. He was confused on what happened since Mr. Leonard was a good athlete who broke records doing 400 meter hurdles in college as a freshman. Mr. Leondard told him that he was a good athlete, but not a good student. He could not read. And Paul wanted to help. He wanted to return the favor and train him and to help him read, because Mr. Leonard first trained him on the hurdles and it motivated him to know he can do anything and that it just takes training.
20895	8	0	0	It didn't occured to the narrator at first when Mr. Leonard asked him for his name, but later the narrator realized that it was an odd question because Mr. Leonard checked the narrator's hall pass, which had his name on it, twice every week. Later the narrator found some information about Mr. Leonard as a track player in college. The narrator was curious about what had happened to Mr. Leonard after his broken record as a college freshman. Mr. Leonard sheeplishly told the narrator that he flunked out the college because he couldn't read very well. Then the narrator realized that Mr. Leonard asked for his name because he couldn't read the narrator's hall pass.
20896	8	2	2	The information that Paul gets is really familiar to him. He is used to the embarrassment of not being able to read just like Mr. Leonard is. In paragraph 45 Paul starts to change his mind about Mr. Leonard.

Also after hearing that Mr. Leonard had fluncked out of college after his freshman year because he had to rely on his friends to get him through school, it encouraged Paul to study his hardest and in his tutoring class, so that he could be a track allstar some day in college, but to be able to handle the rigorous school work that comes with college.
20900	8	1	1	The effect that the reader , Paul gets when he finds out background information about Mr. Leonard, is that he is suprised that Mr. Leonard never mentioned anything about. The authors shows that he is suprised because the passage say that paul askes him why didn't he ever tell him anything about it.

20909	8	2	2	The effect was that he felt a great deal of respect and awe toward Mr. Leonard. Probably because he was surprised to know that the janitor was such a good hurtler. It made him feel kind of good to know that Mr. Leonard was a hurtler, adn that Mr. Leonard was spending time teaching him how to do this. But then, upon learning that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, it probably made Paul feel kind of awed toward Mr. Leonard because he was like him in those ways.
20910	8	1	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is like him, becasue he can't read and is really good at track. Mr. Leonard does not want Paul to not be able to read and be good at track. He want Paul to be able to read and be good at track.

20924	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard is very much like Paul. He was once a young boy, and possesses some of the same problems that Paul seems to have.      As a young child, Mr. Leonard had distractions and difficulties learning. To this day, as he is telling the story to Paul, he is still unable to read. It is obvious that Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul, and show him that he can pass school, if only he works hard to overcome his obstacles. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out,' Mr. Leonard stated. Paul could see how embarassed the man was to share that, but it only made Paul want to try harder to acheive his grades, and go to college.
20925	8	0	0	When Paul is in school and he has gym class, he is usually always the one thats picked last when it comes to games and sports. He wants to learn how to do a sport good so he doesn't have to be picked last in everything.

20967	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard motivates Paul to help him with something. When he questions him, and finds out the truth, he says, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.'
20968	8	2	2	All the background information on Paul is the same as Mr. Leonard. Paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard asked Paul, 'where do you think you're going.' Paul said, 'Learning center.' Mr. Leonard asked, 'Why.' Paul said, 'Why?' 'I can't read.' Later on in the story Paul pulled out a piece of paper and said, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I looked good back then, didn't I?'

I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always to hard.' Paul said, 'But you went to college.' Mr. Leonard said, 'Things were different back then, the college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked ou. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read. See both Paul and Mr. Leonard can't read. They are almost alike.
20969	8	1	1	The information about Mr. Leonard came shocking to paul and he noticed his teacher as someone like only a janitor, he had no hope in his future and so when he found out about his school janitor he then had the courage to succeed in what he thought was impossible, just like Mr. Leonard.
20970	8	2	2	Paul is a little touched by the information he finds out about Mr.  Leonard. Paul knows with a lot of effort and continued practice he can be a decent track and feild athlete. Paul has a reading disablility and works hard in the school's learning center and disovers that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because of his reading abilities. This motivated Paul to help Mr. Leonard and to make sure he becomes a better reader.
20971	8	2	2	After Paul listend to Mr. Leonard's story about his college experience, it opens his eyes and makes him realize what he must do.

20973	8	0	0	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that
20974	8	0	0	Because then he knows why he didnt say just come on it wont hurt you. Another reason is thats why he knows he couldnt read his name on the hall pass. Also instead of looking at the hall pass he just asked him where he was going. The coach just probably looked at it and pretended to read it. Then at the very end he knows he feels sorry for Paul. Also Paul feels sorry for him and tells the coach come on lets go start your training.
20976	8	0	0	The background check on Paul would be about the same as Mr. Leonard, becasue he was very good at track and field but, he couldn't read. He wanted to help Paul get better at track and field and much better at reading. he wants him to sucess in collage and be great at track and field.

He won many awards for track, but the one disadvantage that he had was he had flunked out of college because he did not know how to read. After Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard could not read because he had to ask him his name, he knew he was going through the same thing. Paul thought that since Mr. Leonard helped him achieve what he wanted with the track, that Paul would help him out by getting back into college. Atleast, try to help him find a center that would enable him to become better at what he could not do. Paul was just helping Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul.

20995	8	2	2	Paul discovers the truth about Mr. Leonard and he was familiar with the same feeling and situation. When Mr. Leonard first tells Paul about what he used to be, Paul was filled with unbelief. Until he explained his situation of not being able to read and dropping out of school, Paul knew those feelings, and it motivates him to try harder to be the best he can while training so that he may make Mr. Leonhard proud.

21008	8	1	1	He feels privledged to have such a great, successful athlete to be training him how to do the hurdles. He wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him why he was so succesful from the beginning when he first started training him.(I pulled out the printout I'd downloaded the night before from my pocket.

Mr. Leonard gave his time to help Paul excel. So Paul decided to see Mr. Leonard excel at something to.
21052	8	2	2	Once Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard past, he is in shock.      Not knowing that the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, was a star in college; who won the four hundred meter hurdles and broke records.

If you dont do it in the classroom then there is no point in even going out to try and do a sport. Mr. Leonard wants to live his dreams through of Paul because he wants Paul to do something that he was not capeable of doing. This was a huge lesson in Paul's life and it took him one step closer to succeeding his dreams and goals.

Paul then must decide to confront Mr. Leonard. Upon doing so, he makes a greater realization that draws him closer to not only Mr. Leonard, but himself too. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard also struggled with literature and reading. In fact, Mr. Leonard's inferiority regarding the subject helps Paul to identify with him, for he too is plagued with the same problem.     Because Paul discovers this, he feels a drive. He feels a reason. He actually begins to feel adequate. Now, with the understanding that he can achieve, he feels reason to pay back the favor. He decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read well. Without knowing that Mr. Leonard had once been such a star athelete who failed in academics, Paul would have never had made such a life changing change -- realizing his value.

21066	8	2	2	I personally think Mr. Leonard giving Paul his story about what he use to be and how it came crashing down really motivated Paul and made him want to help Mr. Leonard. The fact that Mr. Leonard's dream was shattered because couldn't read made Paul want to work hard so that he wouldn't have to fall in the same pattern as Mr. Leonard did when he was younger. He probably felt as if he needed to do something to make up for what happened in his younger years so Paul took him to the learning center so that he could get some much needed help in reading. Paul felt that Mr. Leonard's words were 'all too familiar' because Paul was having trouble reading as well.

We had no learning centers in our school.  I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.'  It turns out that just like Paul, Mr. Leonard is a talented athlete, but did not recieve the resources that he needed to read.

Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read.

21120	8	0	0	The author uses many signs of foreshadowing in this story. The foreshadowing lead the reader to assume he is not educated well.       The author begins by introducing Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor. This suggests to the reader that he does not have an advanced education if he was just a hall monitor. When Mr. Leonard ask Paul what his name is in paragraph 24, it suggest that he either doesnt have a good memory or cannot read the pass. Another incident like this occurs when Paul shows Mr. Leonard his printout, and Mr. Leonard responds with a confused look.

21121	8	1	1	The background information helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him and it allows Paul to help Mr. Leonard in return.
21122	8	2	2	Things were different back then. Mr. Leonard was told that grades didnt matter, that he would have all the help he needed, but that was all a lie. He ended up losing his scholarship, and flunking out of college. No college wanted someone who couldn't read.       Mr.Leonards were words that were familiar to Paul. He was embarrassed when he was called on, or when he didnt know the answer because he couldn't read. All those feelings that Mr.Leonard had, Paul had the exact.       Mr.Leonard gave his time to help Paul succeed at something. After Paul realized what Me.Leonard was doing for him, he wanted to help Mr.Leonard out. Paul had then started training with Mr.Leonard.

21130	8	1	1	It has an effect on Paul because he completely understands what Mr. Leonard has gone through. In a way, he went through the same thing, and it states in the story that Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar. After learning Mr. Leonard's story, Paul now has someone that he can connect with. It also will now make him feel better about himself because he knows he is not the only one that does not achieve at everthing.
21131	8	2	2	From the background of Mr. Leonard, Paul feels that he can relate to him way more because he can not read either. Paul feels that if he can do what Mr. Leonard taught him, he can be just like him. Also, at the end of the story where Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read, Paul wants to teach him to read just like Mr. Leonard taught him to run hurdles.
21132	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard that Paul gets is only a way to motivate him more. He realizes he can be a good athlete even though the has trouble reading, because he has a good relationship with someone who went through the same thing.
21133	8	1	1	The backgroung knowledge that the narrator has for Mr. Leonard, makes the narrator respect Mr. Leonard more. He knows Mr. Leonard is an accomplished athlete that knows what he is talking about, therefore he respects and follows his advice.
21134	8	0	0	When Paul gets the background information about Mr. Leonard, it effects Paul because just like Leonard he can't read. But they both are good at hurdles, only bad thing is that Leonard coldn't get through college because he couldn't read. So that could have a huge effect on Paul because he doesn't know how to read.
21135	8	2	2	When Paul prints out that paper on Mr. Leonard he learns that he was the best hurdler in the nation. Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Just like Paul couldn't.  Then, Mr. Leonard tells Paul how he flunked out of college. Paul realizes how important reading is and that he can overcome any obstacle.
21136	8	2	2	When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard, he feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Since both of them couldn't read in school and wre both great runners. It also determines Paul to do better in school and track.
21138	8	2	2	Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a really good track athlete but he could not read very well.  Paul didn't understand how he got to college. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.  'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
21139	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard handed the paper back and looked at the ground, his brow furrowed, his voice cracked as he spoke.
21141	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard eventually tells Paul that he also had difficulties reading and doing school work in general when he was Paul's age. However, he was a good runner. His athletic ability got him into college but later, as a result of his lack of academic ability, he was kicked out. Paul could very much relate to Mr. Leonard's words. When Mr. Leonard told him all of this, Paul was then encouraged to help him learn academically, considering Mr. Leonard had help him achieve success in running the hurdles.
21142	8	1	1	'But you went to college', Paul seems as if he's supprised.
21144	8	1	1	It helps Paul find out who Mr. Leonard is. It also helps him understand how similar each of them are to each other.
21147	8	2	2	I think the background information of Mr. Leonard inspired Paul. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star track runner, he was shocked that Mr. Leonard had not already told him. Paul decided that he wanted to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read because afterall Mr. Leonard was helping him become a track runner. This helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners.
21148	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul makes him see Mr. Leonard as an inspiration. The information allows Paul to personally see himself in Mr. Leonard and he compares himself to him. For instance, when he reads the information from the website about Mr. Leonard, he is astonished by his accomplishments. Once Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his past, Paul is inspired by his words. Once the information has sunk in to Paul's mind, he uses Mr. Leonard's story to motivate himselft to be better than Mr. Leonard has turned out to be.
21149	8	2	2	He is familiar with the things that Mr. Leonard had went through. Neither of them can read very well. Paul feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard with his reading skills since he helped Paul improve his running ability.
21150	8	1	1	I  think paul knowing about Mr. leonard is a good thing it shuold make paul want to strive to trie harder so he doesnt end up in the same situation as Mr. Leonard.
21151	8	2	2	He was intrigued by the efforts of Mr. Leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out. Because Mr. Leonard flunked, he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed.  In the last sentence, Paul says, ''C'mon, Mr. Lenoard. It's time to start your training.'' He want's to help him to excel at something as Mr. Leonard had for him.
21152	8	2	2	The effect that the background information that Paul finds on Mr.Leonard is shocking to Paul. He wanted to why Mr.Leonard wouldn't tell him about about Mr.Leonard being the star athelet when he was in high school. When Paul meets up with Mr.Leonard he asks him, ' Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr.Leonard then goes on with his story about how he use to be like Paul and flunked out of college because of his grades and how he was told in high school that he couldn't do track anymore because of his grades and that in college they would have tutors for him.
21153	8	2	2	Paul does not know what Mr. Leonard did before he worked at the school. Paul is amazed when he learns that Mr. Leonard ran track in college and set national records as a freshman. Mr. Leonard then says he wasn't a good student and his running career was ended because of it. Paul realizes how important it is to be good in school and offers to repay Mr. Leonard for his time by teaching him how to read.
21154	8	2	2	The high school track and field coach automatcially assumed that Leonard Grabowski was the person that was helping Paul with track. He also gives Paul a piece of paper with a website URL and tells him to do a search for Grabowski. This search pulls up information about Leonard and how good he was at the hurdles his freshman year in college. Paul asked Leonard what had happened after Leonard had the best race of his life. Leonard told Paul that he was a good athelete, but he didn't know how to read, so he was a horrible student. This was touching to Paul because now he had someone else to relate to since Leonard didn't know how to read either. The information that Paul got will push him harder to learn how to read.
21155	8	1	1	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is to try harder. When Paul showed Mr. Leonard that he knew about his times in college, Mr. Leonard told Paul how hard it was
21157	8	2	2	The information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard was sympathetic for him. Mr. Leonard, like Paul, had trouble reading. He also had potentinal to be a star track athlete. However, Mr. Leonard had no chance to receive any help with his reading issues and as such was not able to make it. At the end of the story, it's implied that Paul was going to help Mr. Leonard with his reading, just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul with his track prowess.
21158	8	2	2	It surprises him because Mr. Leonard never told him about how he was a college track star. It also makes him very excited that he is being coached by a college star.
21159	8	2	2	Paul understands now that the reason Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul is because he too couldnt read when he was in High School. And realizes that they are a lot a like
21160	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a big track star, and that he could not read. So, Paul believes that Mr. Leonard is helping him because he knows what its like not to read and to be picked on and flunk out of school.

21162	8	0	0	Paul wants to be like Mr. lenard now. So he askes Mr.lenard about his college track days.
21163	8	2	2	Paul was influenced by Mr. Leonard trying to help him, and it was more helpful to Paul to see that Mr. Leonard had struggled with the same pronlems that Paul himselkf struggles with.  It  means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing.  An example would be, Mr. Leonard doesn't help Paul learn to read, but he starts to train him in hurdles, helping him learn how to over come obsticals.
21164	8	2	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard had broken records, in track and field, and had gone to college, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had never shared said information with him. When he asked Mr. Leonard about it, he discovered that, much like himself, Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning in school.After discovering that he had many things in common, academically, with Mr. Leonard, Paul decided that he would help Mr. Leonard much like Mr. Leonard had voluntarily helped him. He began 'training' Mr. Leonard to read well.

Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college fresham who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records for the school, but like Paul he had a really hard time in school and had noone to help him so he flunked out.

21295	8	0	0	Well he didn't know what to think about he had all these questions to ask Mr. Leonard. He had asked him why he hadn't told him about this, and that he was pretty much the best runner on the team.

21296	8	2	2	The effect that the background information of Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that he was surprised because Mr. Leonard hadn't told him anything about it, let alone mention it. When Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college because he had reading problems, and the homework was to hard for him to understand, he knew that it was his turn to help improve Mr. Leonard's reading like he had helped him improve hurdeling.

21302	8	0	0	Their are many effects that Paul recieves after learning about Mr. Leonards past. After hearing Mr. Leonards past story Paul believes now that he needs to work hard at learning how to read. He also finds information about  Mr. Leonard being a college freshman athlete who won records and hurdled in the national race. This effected Paul because he didn't understand how after college he became a hall monitor. He was so successful. Mr. Leonard explained to him, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This impacted Paul into teaching Mr. Leonard about high school and decided to step up. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'
21303	8	1	1	Paul is suprised at what he finds because Lenard didnt  tell hima nyhting about his past and Paul found out for him-self.
21304	8	1	1	It makes him feel that he owed mr. Lenard so he is willing to help him read. after mr.Lenard helped him with the track.
21305	8	2	2	Paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too.  Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read just as Paul can't. He decides that since Mr. Leonard taught him to hurdle he would teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21306	8	2	2	Paul was not expecting to find out something so interesting about Mr. Leonard. The next day after finding the information about Mr. Leonard. He asked him about it. Mr. Leonard did not seem to excited and happy when he saw what Paul had. Even though he felt embarrassed by the past. He still answered Paul.     After listening to Mr. Leonard explain his past. He felt familiar with the feelings. Paul felt inspired. He then asked Mr. Leonard to come with him. So, Paul could then help Mr. Leonard just like he done for Paul.
21307	8	1	1	He has always looked up to Mr. Leonard, so when he found out all the things that had happen to himin college, i think at first he was shocked but then he heard more. Paul had kind of realized that Mr. leonard was like him when he was his age. I just think it make Paul and Mr. Leonard closer.
21308	8	0	0	The background information on Mr. leonard is like how he was good at track in college and he actually flunks out of college which there for he can't do track and field anymore,
21309	8	1	1	It has an effect because Paul does not want to lose a scholarship if he gets one.
21311	8	2	2	Paul can relate to how Mr. Leonard feels. He has felt the same way before and still does in school. In a way the two are very much alike in more than one way. Both are very well runners but fail to excel in school. This makes Pual want to help himself and Mr. Leonard by putting Mr. Leonard through a different type of training, reading.
21312	8	1	1	He is very surprised he is like him. He is kinda mad he didnt tell him about himself. When he learns that he was good at track he is amazed and doesn't know what to think. It's like he didnt even believe him at first. He is amazed to see how far he has come.
21313	8	0	0	Mr leonard used to be a track coach.
21314	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard about him being a good athlete was shocking to Paul. As Mr. Leonard went on about his college life, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is remedial to reading also. They have so much in common because they both got put last in every thing and no one wanted them because of there remediation.
21315	8	2	2	Paul towards the end of the story is informed that Mr. Leonard was a college track star. Mr. Leonards tells him while in high school he struggled with reading. He also told him he never learned and was kick out of college becasue of his lack of reading skills. This allowed Paul to see that him and Mr Leonard were similar. Mr Leonard effected Paul by telling him know that he can get over any hurdle.
21316	8	1	1	The effect the information has on Paul is that he is just like Mr. Leonard. He relizes that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him be the best he can be. He relizes that he can over come his reading problem and can learn to read just like he has learned to do the hurtles.
21318	8	2	2	The effect that Mr. Leonard's background has on Paul is that he knows the feeling and feels really bad for him.  Paul says he knows the embarrasment of not being able too read. Now Paul wants too help Mr. Leonard learn how too read.
21319	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard shows Paul that even those who struggle have the gifts to be great at things. Before the background information is given, Paul failed to see the connection that he had with Mr. Leonard. After Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard's past, he realizes the similarities between their situations and can connect the reasons Mr. Leonard is helping him.
21320	8	1	1	When paul hears mr.leonards background information he starts to understand why Mr. leonard helps him. Also he kinda connects with Mr.leonard because he met and adult thats is and was in the same place that he's in. They both had the same feelings when it came to reading.
21321	8	1	1	Paul began to realize how much his teacher, Mr. Leonard, and he had in common. Paul was just now learning why this man had came to him in the first place, he couldn't possibably know what Mr. Leonard wanted with him. So Paul was in surpirse with him or maybe a little disapointed that he wasn't giving the information or the insight on his mentor.
21322	8	2	2	During the story, the reader gets information about Mr. Leonard's track records.  Paul now knows that Mr. Leonard was once a wonderful track star, and he is now helping Paul become better.  The background information that has the greatest effect on Paul is that Mr. Leonard has a reading problem, just like him.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul to become better at hurdles, now Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard become better at reading.
21323	8	2	2	In the story Paul finds out Mr. leonard was a famous track runner in college. Then also finds out that he flunked out because he couldn't read. It makes Paul feel like he can relate to someone. he even says 'The emotions in Mr Leonard's words were all too familiar.' As if he knows exactly how Mr. Leonard feels.
21324	8	2	2	The infromation that Paul finds out makes him feel sorry for Mr. Leonard because he has felt the same way because he has trouble reading also.  This is why at the end of the story Paul decides to help teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21325	8	2	2	It effects Paul, because he can relate to Mr. Leondard's story. Bad reading skills, trained to get good at track, etc. In a way, I think it motivates Paul to become good at track, but also focus on getting into a good college and using the learning center to get his reading to a better level.
21326	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background information effected Paul by making him realize that he and Mr. Leonard are similar. This is because both have stuggled with reading. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard because in pargraph 45 Paul references a time when he was too embarresed to answer in class because he couldn't read aloud the answer.
21327	8	2	2	The background information he recieves from his track coach to research about Mr. Leonard gives Paul a whole new way to look at Mr. Leonard. Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at natuionals. He discovered he broke records, and asked Mr. Leonard about his past life. The information Paul soon recieves from Mr. leonard has a great impact on him. This is so by Mr. Leonard also not being able to read like Paul, although they didn't have service learning centers back then. Therefore, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard begin to start reading.
21328	8	2	2	During the story, Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past as a college hurdler. Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed about his reading problem as well. He felt that it was fair to help Mr. Leonard. After all, Mr. Leonard had helped Paul discover that he could excel in hurdles. Paul then led Mr. Leonard back to the school with the intent to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21329	8	2	2	One effect that learning about Mr. Leonards track history had was giving Paul the idea to help Mr. Leonard to read. Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard.     Knowing his past could have also given Paul a reason to excel in track. Since Mr. Leonard failed out of college although being an excellent althelete, Paul might want too prove himself to Mr. Leonard and himself that he can succeed. Also, if Paul succeeds, Mr. Leonard does too, since he taught Paul everything.
21330	8	0	0	MR.Leonard is a classic exsampel of a person who is focast on his sport and not on his grades only to find out later in life that he needed the grades more than the sport.
21331	8	0	0	You can be great at things but you should never give up on things that you struggle on, like the hurdle the first time Paul did them.
21332	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard is kind of like Paul they both have troube with reading but thry are both wonderful athletes and Mr. Leonard wants Paul to succeed in life he wants Paul to have the oppurti\unity that he didnt.
21333	8	2	2	Paul thinks of himself as not as good as evrybody else because he can't read well and at first didn't play any sports. He seems to think he is the only athlete that has problems with school grades. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but didn't know how to read. This makes Paul think that he is not the only one who has problems reading and is an athlete. This seems to make Paul feel better about himself and helps him decide to encourage Mr. Leonard to start learning to read.
21334	8	1	1	I belive that the background information that Paul found out about Mr. Leonard drove him to be better and live up to his dreams. Paul wanted to learn how to read and be better at sports, but without and education he would not be able to go into colloge and be better at the sports he wanted too be in.
21335	8	0	0	He went to college and was a big athlete and broke the records but Mr. Leonard didn't graduate because he couldn't read.
21336	8	1	1	Well he learns that this weird hall guy or whatever is really a famous track runner and that he couldent read also. This in turn shows that if the narrator learns to read and tries hard that he can do the same, but without the flunking college thing. Also at the end akes him want to return the favor in a way for all the training that he gave him for some reading lessons i guess.
21337	8	2	2	The background information made Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard was a hall monitor. Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles and broke school records for it. Paul was surprised to hear how Mr. Leonard couldn't read. That he flunked out of college because he was never learned how to read.
21338	8	2	2	Paul is very suprised that Mr.Leonard had not told him about how he was a college track star. Paul asked him 'why didn't you tell me about this'.
21339	8	2	2	When Paul found out that Mr. leonard did hurdles in collage  (38 ran 400 meter hurdles at the nationals) he was very enthused.
21340	8	0	0	The background information about Mr. Leonard when he was a freshman in collage is similar to what is wrong with Paul. Paul has troubles reading and so does Mr. Leonard, Paul is a rare child that get chossen last in every sport.     Mr. Leonard was one of those kids in school because he couldnt read, so everyone choose him last in every sport. Mr. Leonard came cobncerned when he stopped Paul in the hallway at achool and asked him where he was going when Paul said the kearning center because i dont know how to read.     Both of them were tired of being choosen last in everything no matter what it was.
21341	8	0	0	He probably didn't know that Mr. Leonard ran track and broke many records. He had to keep that a secret from Paul. So his hopes wouldn't come crashing down just because he couldn't read. He didn't want that to happen to Paul.
21343	8	1	1	That Mr.Leonard is a good and talented athlete, but a very poor reader. Paul knows the feeling of not knowing how to read. Finding out about Mr. Leonard pushes Paul to read and work hard.
21344	8	1	1	It effects Paul because now he realizes that to get into college he has to do well in School. He knows this now because Mr. Leonard dropped out of college because he couldn't make the grades even though he had scholarships.
21345	8	2	2	When Paul received information about Mr. Leonard he was shocked. He did not know that he was a record breaking track runner, or that he did not finish track and for that matter collage.
21347	8	1	1	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete he questions what happend after that.  Mr. Leonard states, 'but not a good student' (42).  By saying this, Paul realizes that even if you are good at one thing, does not mean you shouldnt try anything else.  Mr. Leonard should have tried in school, and Paul should have been extending his boundries and comfort zone.  Also, it taught Paul that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.
21348	8	0	0	pau  is a trsck player in high school still, he's trynna get improvement on his track so he can win turnments, also he's a very fast runner to
21349	8	2	2	I will write about why i feel that what paul found out about Mr. Leonard effects him in anyway.     I think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teacher/coach. When he told Mr. Leonard about the url he reccived Mr. Leonard told paul about his past. Thats why I think that what paul found out about mr. leonard effects. They basically have the same issuses in their lifes.     Another reason why I feel like it effects paul is because paul can relate to Mr. Leonard and paul can understand how he feels. Paul and Mr. Leonard have the same issuse with reading and paul feels since he is learning how to read he can teach/help Mr. Leonard at reading also.
21350	8	1	1	It makes paul feel like he needs to help Mr. Leonard on his reading.
21351	8	0	0	he takes paul to different places to see what hes interested in and he found it by going out on the track.
21352	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner.  Because Paul, like Mr. Leonard, can not read very well and doesn't want to end up dropping out of college like Mr. Leonard did.
21354	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard's background information explained that he was a hall monitor whom everyone obeyed and never thought about anything else. This kind of reputation encouraged Paul to simply and blankly do as Mr. Leonard told him. It even encouraged Paul to obey Mr. Leonard on something as strange as being told to run hurdles on the track field.
21355	8	2	2	When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past he is encouraged because Mr. Leonard could not read but still broke records in track. Paul also want to return the kindness Mr. Leonard has shown him so Paul is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21357	8	0	0	It tells the reader qbout him as well as adding aditions to the story.
21358	8	2	2	Throughout the story there are times when you suspect that Mr. Leonard is just like Paul. When they are at the track and Mr. Leonard asks for Pauls name, is a good sign that Mr. Leonard cannot read either. Mr. Leonard sees in Paul the likeness and commoness that they share. The effect it has on Paul is the support he gets from someone just like him. Paul can finally believe he can be great at something and that trying hard is not just a waste of time. Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul out, but the only way for him to help is if Paul lets him. Paul may not know exactly what Mr. Leonard went through right off the bat. But little by little Paul finds out and it motivates Paul to be a better person, athlete and harder worker.
21360	8	1	1	Paul was disapointed with Mr. Leonard. Paul showed this by saying 'Why didnt you tell me about this?' After Paul finds this out it incourages him more to jump hurdles and have him as a coach and train him. Paul wants to do better then Mr. Leonard.
21361	8	2	2	Paul can't read and neither could Mr. Leonard. So when Mr. Leonard starts training Paul he doesn't tell him his story because he doesn't want him to discouraged and stop. When Paul does find out his story he asked about it. Mr. Leonard explained it to him and inspired Paul to help him. At the end of the story Paul takes Mr. Leonard to his reading class and says 'it's time to start your training.' Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, he returns the favor.
21362	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard has trouble reading just like him. Also, Paul understands why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him be good in a sport that he liked because Mr. leonard didn't want him to be left out the same way he was when he was in college.
21363	8	2	2	Paul does research and realizes that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler who broke records in only his freshman year. When he questions Mr. Leonard what happened to him Leonard tells him that he flunked out because he could not read. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read'. This touches Paul because he cannot read either. It makes him feel much more comfortable around Leonard now that he knows they both have experienced similar 'hurdles' in life.
21364	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul heard was touching to him. He knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment. An example of how Paul knew those feelings, where when he gets called upon to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer that everyone else knew. I think Paul could really relate to Mr. Leonard and also so could Mr. Leornard relate to Paul. Since Mr. Leonard taught him a lesson and helped him out, he wants to teach him how to read.
21365	8	0	0	When Paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. Leonard.  Paul wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him that he was a college track superstar.  Therefore, Paul asked Mr. Leonard that exact question the next day.
21366	8	0	0	The information Paul found could have discourage him, as well as him feeling betraded an lied to by Mr. leonard.  Just by PAul printing something out an even showing it to him showed it bothered it alot.
21367	8	1	1	Paul was shock to discover that his caoch, was the best runner in college his freshman year. Paul didnt know the reason why he didnt know about Mr. Leonard achievement. When paul discovered what happen he was sad.  Now paul wants to read more so he can be better and become just like Mr. Leonard.
21372	8	1	1	He weent and got his records and oictures and showed him which made him want to help Mr.Leonard.
21373	8	0	0	That you can do anything if you put your mind to it. And you dont have to be smart to do big things in life.
21374	8	0	0	The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard has an effect on him. He didn't know, at the beginning, that he was being trained by someone who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals.      Mr. Lenonard didn't want to tell Paul at the beginning because he thought that if he had told him, he wouldn't want to train or try something new. However, if Paul had known, things may have been better or would of had a better outcome when he was training.      The saying, 'don't judge a book by it's cover', has meaning here. Mr. Leonard is the book, and just because he's the hall monitor doesn't meant that he didn't have a successful past. Paul getting to know Mr. Leonard was a way for him to become someone.
21375	8	2	2	Paul is surprised because he never knew that the guy whos been helping and motivating was once an college track star.
21376	8	0	0	It kind of shows him what kind of person Mr. Leonard was back then.
21377	8	2	2	Paul is effected by finding out Mr. Leonard's backround as a star in track is, Paul becomes inspired to do well in track, just like Mr Leonard.
21379	8	1	1	That he wanted to help Mr. Leonard with his challenge of reading.It said that no other school wanted a runner who could not read.So that  Mr. Lenord can go to college to complete his goal.
21380	8	2	2	I think that Mr. Leonards' background information has a big effect on Paul. I think this because before Mr. Leonard actually talked to Paul, Paul had no idea what Mr. Leonards' past life was like. In sentence thirty eight Paul said this 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This makes me think that Paul will try harder at everything he does, just because he found out about Mr. Leonards' past.
21381	8	1	1	He begins to understand why Mr. Leonard was so nice to him and that he just wanted Paul to do well in track but also do well in school.
21382	8	1	1	He feels like it was too familiar for him and they went through the same stuff. Now he wants to help him out.
21383	8	1	1	When Paul learns about what Mr. Leonard used to be he is suprised. You know this by how he shows Mr. Leonard the picture and the printout that the track coach gave him in line 38. But he also feels more conected with him this is shown in line 45.
21384	8	1	1	It makes Paul and Mr. Loenard better friends because he was helping him train and he was being very good to him and Paul was being good and progressing very well and when he found out about his trainer he wanted to help him just like his trainer helped him.
21385	8	0	0	Paul was a great athlete but he cound not read. Paul didnt know who Mr. Leonard was and Mr. Leonard liked that because he was embarresed of not being able to read. when he did find out paul didnt care until he started coaching him and helping him with his sport.
21386	8	1	1	paul is very simpathetic and so he teaches him to do hurtles. he tells the nararator that he needs to meet him in the gym at 2:30
21387	8	2	2	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past he's at first surprised and wonders why this was kept from him all this time and why he would go through all the trouble to teach him. Once he learns that he flunked college because he couldnt read well, that encourged Paul to work harder at reading and teach Mr.Leonard how to read better just like he taught Paul to be a athlete.
21389	8	1	1	Paul understand how Mr. Leonard feels because of Paul own experiences he is going through in his life. Paul experiences some of the feeling with Mr, Leonard because when he was in class with the others students he would have feel bad when the teacher calls on him, but he didn't know the answer to the question.
21390	8	2	2	The background story of Mr. Leonard is something that is familiar to Paul. Mr. Leonard had went through school not knowing how to read. He had a difficult time throughout high school and college. He had nobody to help him. Paul has help, from both his tutor and Mr. Leonard. He feels as if all the help Leonard has given, he should return some of it. Paul wants to help him, just as he helped Paul.
21391	8	1	1	The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard makes him want to help Mr. Leonard, because he helped him.
21392	8	2	2	When Paul does background check on Mr. Leonard he is very suprised at what he finds. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship. When Paul told Mr. Leonard that he knew about he history in track and wanted to know why he did not tell him of his great achivements. When Paul hears that he flunked school because he could not read Paul feels for him because he is in the same situation and knows how it feels.
21393	8	0	0	Because he want's him to find out everything about track and field. and then he find's out Mr. Leonard was a track and field runner and he broke records in college. As a freshman and then he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, and no one wanted a runner that couldn't read. So he gave up so he wanted to help paul and so paul wouldn't be like Mr. Leonard when he was a kid so he started training paul after school and getting him in shape for track and field. so he can be on the team just like him back in the day.
21394	8	0	0	Paul feels mostly happy about this and also has a lot of questions for Mr. Leonard. When Mr. Leonard saw that picture of him as a teenager and smiled you could tell he was happy to answer his questions.
21395	8	1	1	Paul was working on his hurdling and the high school track coach came up and talked to him. Paul got a URL for the Track and Field website, and the coach said 'do a search for 'Grabowski.' Which Grabowski is the guy that has been training Paul to be good at Hurdles. Once Paul did his search on his trainer he was surprised about the things that Grabowski did.
21396	8	2	2	In what Paul says in paragraph 35 we can infer that he is amazed that Mr. Leonard was a track star in high school and confused that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him. It also probably suprised him that Mr. Leonard didn't become famous because he couldn't read because earlier in the story he was confused because Mr. Leonard asked his name after seeing his hall pass on multiple occasions.
21397	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college track star that broke many records. Then a while later Paul has a conversation with him. Mr. Leonard tells him that he had to drop out because he wasn't a good student. This relates to Paul because he can't read that well.
21398	8	2	2	Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard. He knew how it felt not to read. He wanted to help Mr. Leonard since he helped him.
21399	8	0	0	Mr.Leonard began walking back toward the school,then turned and asked
21400	8	1	1	I think it motivated Paul to do better in school and do be the best at track that he could be.
21401	8	0	0	Paul thinks that sense Mr. Leonard trained him to become a good reader that he thinks he should go to college and graduate college unlike Mr. Leonard who flunked out because he couldnt read. Paul was going to the learning center to learn how to read, so Mr. Leonard seen he was trying and it made him proud,just because you cant read dont mean you cant succeed in life.
21402	8	1	1	ITS SURPRISES HIM A LOT. WHEN HE IS ASKING MR. LEONARD WHY WAS HE HIDING THAT FROM HIM
21403	8	2	2	Paul is embarrassed by his reading problems but, later he finds out that Mr. Leonard and him are not so different because in Mr. Leonard's past life as a hurdler he struggled with reading too.
21405	8	0	0	From the stroy Paul has a reading disablility and has a hard time reading. In a simmular background Mr. Leonard was a excelling Track athlete in the 400 meter hurdels. From Mr. Leonard's past he dosen't whant to have someone repeating his failures.
21406	8	2	2	The effect the background information has on Paul is understanding. Paul sees that to be successful that he has to learn to read. And if you dont that you miss out on really good oppurtunity's that will never come again. Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he isn't embarrassed about not being able to read for the rest of his life.
21407	8	1	1	The backround information effected Paul because it made him feel like he can come over any obsticle in life. Paul came to conclusions that he can achieve anything if he put effort into it. Once he read on Mr. Leonard background that gave him motivation to accomplish his goals.
21408	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in school, but not a great student. Mr. Leonard struggled when it came to school and didn't have the help he needed to be a better student. His friends helped him out a little, but once he got to college everything got harder. Mr. Leonard had problems with reading, just like Paul. Mr. Leonard shows Paul that he can be a good athlete just like he was when he was in high school. Just because Paul has a har time reading, doesn't mean he cannot be sucessful in sports. Paul is lucky enough to have tutors, and someday Paul could run hurdles in college and be able to live out Mr. Leonard's dream.
21409	8	1	1	It shows Paul a different side of life. Also its helps motivate him to keep goin. It make s him want to help Mr.Leonard. Plus its something that Paul understands because in a sense he is kind of like MR.leonard
21410	8	1	1	The background information that Paul recieves helps him to see why Mr. Leonard was helping him and pushing him.
21411	8	1	1	The background information that paul has recieved is shocking.  Paul had no clue that Mr. Leonard was so good at hurdles.  Paul wonders why that he didn't go pro and didn't finish college out.
21412	8	2	2	The background information Mr. Leonard told Paul took an effect on him. Paul realized that if he tried harder at his reading and at his hurdles he could go to college with a scholarship, like Mr. Leonard, but graduate. It's teaching Paul a lesson that your education is what really matters.
21413	8	0	0	He questions him about it, he wants to know why he stoped.
21414	8	2	2	When he realizes that his coach is a famous athlete his whole attitude towards him changes. He realizes that he was once a great athlete and that is why hes trying to help him. Yet then he finds out that he cant read, this discourages him yet brings him to the conclusion that since Mr.Leonard taught him well its time to teach him something.
21416	8	0	0	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that whether you are a bad reader or you feel like an outcast, you can always be a success in something.
21417	8	0	0	The information has an effect on paul because he has a way of learning how to read and learning things as Mr. Leonard dont no how to do some of the stuff that they have got to do.
21418	8	1	1	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past it made him want to work harder in hurdling and in his efforts for reading. He said that Mr. Leonard's emotions were familiar to him, so now he will work hard to help himself and Leonard
21420	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard feels the same way he does about reading.  He wants to help Mr. Leonard to become a better reader, just like Mr. Leonard is helping him with track.
21421	8	2	2	Paul is motivated by the information because Mr. Leonard was a star athelete and has given his time to help his time to help excel at something.  Paul also is sympathetic towards his coach because Mr. Leonard can't read, like Paul.  Paul is then motivated to invest time in Mr. Leonard teaching him something that he doesn't know how to do.
21426	8	2	2	paul feels that he can relate to the janator and is glad to know that he is not the only one with the problem of not being able to read verry well
21427	8	0	0	The background information makes Paul curious at first. It makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his past. It made him question Mr. Leonard about why he didn't share the information. It also makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't make it any farther with the sport. It brought up the conversation between the two of them when Paul found out about the whole story behind Mr. Leonards track career.
21428	8	0	0	That Mr. Lenoard was a godo athlete but he didnt do good in school so he got fluncked and he wants to help the narator so that he can do good in school and have a succesful careere.
21429	8	1	1	After hearing the story Mr. Leonard has to say about his past, the narrator feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and understands what he went, and still is , going through. The backgrrround story really brought them closer together because it made the narrrator feel like Mr. Leonard isn't so much of a stranger, but someone a lot like him.
21430	8	2	2	That Paul is totally suprised about the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard being a track star in college and being one of the best. Thats been training him on the track everyday. From going to the learnign center during the week and then having Mr. Leonard teach him how to hurtle and train him. Then Mr. leonard tells him why he drops out of college from not knowing how to read and that you are lucky that you have a learning center. Then Paul looks at Mr. Leonard and says you have training to do.
21431	8	0	0	He finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, and wonders why he didn't tell him about it. In the story he asks Mr. Leonard, 'why didn't you tell me about this?'
21432	8	2	2	During the story, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and that he went to college and ran hurdles. But he also finds out that Mr. Leonard didn't do well in school. So Paul can kind of relate to this. I think that this helps Paul realize that he could be good at something too.
21433	8	2	2	He figures out that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler which he then asks him why ne never told him and then Mr. Leonard told him that he was embarrased because he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read so Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard took such interest in him after school. Paul then decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21434	8	2	2	The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard makes him suspicious of why Mr. Leonard did not tell Paul about his past.  Paul finds it odd that Mr. Leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star.  After finding the background information about Mr. Leonard Paul says to him, 'Why didn't you tell me about this? You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  You broke records.'  Paul says this to Mr. Leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments.  Surprisingly, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is more like himself then he realized.  Paul discovers one of Mr. Leonards most emabarassing secrets, that he has never learned to read either and that his grades were so bad that he flunked out of college.  Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard asked him his name that first day at the track; he was never able to read Paul's name on his hall pass.  After learning about Mr. Leonard's past, it motivates Paul to work even harder at school and at track.  It also gives Paul the idea to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.  Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul realize that if he worked hard then he would be capable of anything.
21435	8	2	2	In the story Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a track star in college and that he broke records. He also found out that he could not read although he was a great runner. When Paul finds out this information it gives him motivation to try harder and to work at things that do not always come easy to everyone. This motivates Paul to work hard in his tutoring and in the Learning Center. It also gives him the motivation to tutor Mr. Leonard at the end of the story. He thinks that it is time for Mr. Leonard to learn how to read.
21438	8	2	2	Paul was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard was a hurdler in college. That information motivated Paul to be a better hurdler. It made the bond that Paul and Mr. Leonard shared, stronger.
21440	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can't read just like himself. So Paul now understands why Mr. L told him to meet him after school. Paul then realizes what he could do for Mr. L.
21442	8	2	2	At the beginning of the story, Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard is just a grumpy man who wants to get kids in trouble. Then, he helps Paul learn the hurdles, and Paul begins to like him. When the track coach told Paul to search for Mr. Leonard on the internet, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard has a learning disability just like he does. This helps Paul to know that he isn't the only one who feels embarrassed about not being able to read. Paul also realized that Mr. Leonard helped him become so good at something. In return, Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21443	8	2	2	The information connects Paul with Mr. Leonard and shows how they are similar like the 'feelings of embarrassment'.It also makes him realize that he helped him excel at something out of his own time, which makes Paul want to help him read.
21444	8	2	2	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he was so amazed that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles and didn't tell him about it.  The effect really sinks into to Paul that Mr. Leonard was just like him. Paul states 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.' this means that he is greatful that someone like him would do something like that to help Paul achieve something great, and right then Paul realized that he then needed to return the favor to Mr. Leonard. By helping him train again.
21445	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a track star. Once he finds this out, he wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about his past. He asks Mr. Leonard what happened after the race and found out that he flunked out of college because he could not read. Paul knows what it is like not being able to read so he is willing to help Mr. Leonard as Mr. Leonard has helped him.
21446	8	2	2	Paul is amazed at Mr. Leonard when he finds out of his acomplishments as a runner. Paul also finds out about Mr. Leonards weakness as a reader and wants to help him strengethen that weakness as Mr. Leonard helped Paul in his weakness for track.
21447	8	0	0	Paul found out that Mr.Leonard broke records as a college freshmen and even went to nationals
21448	8	2	2	Paul is happy an shocked at the same time. He didnt know that Mr. Leonard was a track star. Mr. Leonard trained Paul, so now Paul wants to train Mr. Leonard to read.
21449	8	2	2	When the track caoch gives Paul the URL and tells him too look up Mr. Leonard he was shocked to find out that he broke alot of records and was really good. When Mr. Leonard told Paul the reson why he can't do it anymore is because he didn't know how to read and flunked out of college, it reminded Paul of himself because he didn't know how to read and goes to a tutor. 'Hey  my friend, where do you think your going?' 'learning center' 'why?' because I don't know how to read.'
21450	8	0	0	When Paul comes in with background information about Mr. Laonard, his coach is initially is reliving his glory days as a young, talented athelete, but as he continues to tell his story, he begins to feel sad. In paragraph 41, it says 'Mr. Leonard handed kthe paper back and looked at the fround, his brow furrowed, his voice cracked as he spoke.' This indicates that Paul bringing back this information really had an effect on Mr. Leonard. He was embarrased at the fact that he couldn't read, but he knew that because Paul was a slow reader himself, he knew Paul could relate.
21451	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was just like Paul. He could not read but he could run. Just like Paul. Mr. Leonard wanted something out of this kid so he could live his memory through someone else. He did not want to Paul ot end up like himself. He just wmated Paul to be the best athlete in track and get good grades so another kid doesnt easte his talent like he did.
21452	8	0	0	The boy who wanted to join the track team is or could be the best. It could be some one else thou. we will never know for shore.
21453	8	2	2	The background information causes Paul to feel closer to Mr. Leonard. For example, the two talk in a serious tone about what happened to Mr. Leonard. Also, Paul now has something else in common with Mr. Leonard, a difficulty reading. The background information also allows Paul to return Mr. Leonard's favor of teaching him to run track. Paul can now teach Mr. Leonard how to read and do well in school.
21454	8	2	2	The effect that Paul recieved from getting information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul had felt the same exact way. Paul knew what he was talking about. Since Mr. Leonard had helped him greatly with the hurdles, he felt as if he should help him how to read. So Paul took him down to the learning center so Mr. Leonard could know how to read.
21455	8	0	0	he sees that mr. leonard used to be a track star
21456	8	0	0	Getting Mr.Leonard's information has a big effect on Paul.
21458	8	2	2	The narrator was beginning to realize that he was good at track. When he realized that Mr. Leonard had great success in the 400 meter hurdles, but couldn't read, Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had the same experience he was having. Paul then wanted to help Mr. Leonard with reading in the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with track.
21459	8	2	2	The background information effects Paul because now he knows why Mr. Leonard wants to help him be successful. Because Mr. Leonard had been a great runner but couldn't read, he wanted Paul to possess the skills he had in running, but he also wanted Paul to become a better student and have better opportunities than he did himself. Since Paul knows that now, he believes you should pay Mr. Leonard back and help him with what he wasn't good at, which is reading.
21460	8	0	0	the backgroung infromation is about him being a hall  monotor and enjoying it but when thr track comes up he is a really good high school herdeler and knows what he is doing with paul and the coach and he has a good hurdiling future ahead of him.
21461	8	2	2	I think that the back ground information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard makes Paul happy. He now feels like he fits in with Mr. Leonard since they share the same problem.     For example after Mr. Leonard tells Paul his story about how he flunked out of college at the end of the story, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. Paul is happy because he fits in with Mr. Leonard and because he can help Mr. Leonard just like Mr. Leonard helped him learn how to run hurdles.
21462	8	2	2	He learns that Mr. Leonard is the same as him. ' I was a good athlete', 'but not a good student.' and Paul is the same way. He can not read, and struggles with his homework. Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard.
21464	8	2	2	The background information makes Paul feel more confortable with Mr. Leonard. He now knows him and Mr. Leonard are more alike than what he thought. In the beginning of the story Paul thought Leonard was just some hall monitor that was crazy about checking passes. By the end of the story he realized they have a lot in common, as in they both have trouble in school (reading), and they are both good at hurdles. I think Leonard became an inspiration for Paul to try to succeed, and do better than what Leonard did.
21466	8	2	2	After realizing Mr. Leonard's story, Paul appreciates and respects him more for what he did for him.  He sees Mr. Leonard as someone who is caring towards other people and he wants to be like him.  When he tells Mr. Leonard that it was time for his training, he was going to try and teach him how to read better.  It effected him in that it made his heart open to making other people confient and happy.
21468	8	2	2	Paul knows how he feels, and how embarrassing that it was when you couldn't read or understand stuff.  Now that Paul knows Mr. Leonard's history, Paul decides to help him by teaching him how to read.
21469	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard flunked out of collage because he couldnt read and no other collages would take a runner who cant read.
21470	8	2	2	The effect the background information has on Paul made him astounded that Mr. Leonard was a great track star and had the same experiences as he has. Paul was happy that he made a new friend in Mr. Leonard.
21471	8	0	0	That Mr.leonard cant read just like paul and Mr.leonard was a runner so he teaches paul to run like he did when he was in school.
21472	8	0	0	Mr. leonard was a hall monitor  doing his job helping  kids out so that they can read just like helped paul do.
21473	8	0	0	The information about Mr. Leonard led to Paul succeeding in hurdles and able to be on the track team.  Mr. Leonard was a star in college but he still could not read. Paul knew that he couldn't read, but he is able to keep trying due to the learning centers at his school. If he learned how to read well enough he may earn a scholarship and run hurdles in college with the proud feeling of being able to read.
21474	8	2	2	Paul was astonished of Mr. Leonard's accomplishments, saying that he was a college freshmen running the 400 meter hurdles and winning at nationals. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he could not read when he was in school which is ironic because Paul couldnt either, the difference was the Paul had a tutor and back then Mr. Leonard had no tutors when he was in school so he had to drop out.

21479	8	1	1	During the story we get more and more information about Mr. Leonard. This information gives Paul a better understanding on why and how Mr. Leonard was able to give him such accurate training tips. Before the author started to give us information about Mr. Leonard we were, along with paul, given hints into his past such as 'Say, whats your name?'. When Paul revieves all the bacground information, all these hints become apparent, and he understands why he was being helped.
21481	8	0	0	He tries to help the kid in the story because he is working hard to make Mr. Leonard happy and proud of him
21483	8	0	0	When Paul did his bacground on Mr. Leonard, Paul then found out that they both had problems with reading. It says in the passage that Mr. Leonard had problems with reading in college, and flunked out. Paul had problems too, but he started going to a Learning Center for help, and Mr. Leonard too.
21485	8	2	2	Paul is shocked by the news, he gets more interested in Mr.Leonard. He shows Mr.Leonard the picture he pronted out and talksto him like he is shocked. Paul was surprized by the fact Mr.Leonard cant read, and that he was in college. Paul feels the need to help Mr.Leonard just like Mr.Leonard helped him.

21487	8	0	0	It has at first a confusing effect. he could read and he had no Learning Centers to get help and he ened up fluncking out of college, and from there no other college wanted him.
21488	8	2	2	When Paul finds the background information on Mr. Leonard, he seems to be shocked to find out how well Mr. Leonard was in his college past. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records. At the moment when Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his own struggles in school, that's when he realized how he could help Mr. Leonard back for all the help he gave to him.
21489	8	1	1	He knew how he felt, which was feeling embarrassed around others when they had to read in class. He thought of things to do for Mr. Leonard and finally came up with something. They walked back to school so he could train him. Try and make him feel better about himself and not focus on getting flunked out of college.
21490	8	2	2	The background information that Paul got on Mr. Leonard realated to himself. Paul wasn't very good at sports and was not at all an athlete and he couldn't read so he had to go to tutoring for help. Mr. Leonard was a very good athlete, but couldn't read and never got any help so he flunked out of college and lost his scholarship. this showed Paul that he really needed to keep his head in school and do the best he could possibly do.
21491	8	0	0	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that Mr. Leonard was in the same boat as Paul. Paul had a reading problem, and the information about Mr. Leonard said that he flunked out of college because he wasn't able to read. It shows Paul that you have to do your school work and be good at it for you to do what you wish. Also, it shows Paul that he is not the only person with a reading disability, and you can do anything if you set your mind to it.
21492	8	0	0	That he went to school with paul. That Mr.Leonard went to college with pauls dad.
21493	8	0	0	The backround information about Mr.Leonard has an effect on Paul, because they both have had, and do have trouble reading. Also Paul feels like he is left out of sports and is always chosin last in sports, so Mr.Leonard decided to coach Paul in track.
21494	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a college track star who broke records in the hurdles but failed out of college because he couldn't read, Paul feels sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard. The symapthy that Paul feels for Mr. Leonard is from self experience with lack of reading skills. At the end of the story Paul foreshadows that he will help Mr. Leonard with his 'training' or academics.
21495	8	0	0	The effect of the backround information is that the narrator was having trouble in school, just as Mr. Leonard did in college. It also shows that if you do not work your hardest at what you are doing, you will not meet your expectations.
21496	8	1	1	The background information that Mr. Leonard had given Paul had really changed Paul's life. In one respect he felt sorry for his teacher but at the same time, he also found inspiration in his teacher's story.      Mr. Leonard tells how there was no Learning Center when he was in college. He feels confindent that the Learning Center will help Paul. He is also glad that Learning Center is there to help people that are like himself.
21497	8	1	1	it makes him want to do better and wonders why mr. leonard didnt tell him about his college years. when he finds out he wants to help him in any way possible.
21498	8	2	2	Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard was a track star when he went to high school. When Mr. leonard told Paul about him flunking out of college becuase he can not read I think Paul relized that school was important and that he wanted to help Mr. Lenard how to read.
21499	8	2	2	It reminds him of himself on how he also has problems reading. And that he is trying to do better by going to a learning center.
21501	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard and Paul were both not very good at in school. Later Mr. Leonard reveals his college background about having no learning programs and grades not mattering if he was good at sports. Paul understood the trouble and decided to take Mr. Leonard in to a program just like when he took Paul in because he was poor at sports.
21502	8	0	0	The effect on paul was, like he was feeling sad for Mr. Leonard beacus Mr. Leonard was a good runner but he did not do very good in school. (i lost my scholarship and flunked out. no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.)
21503	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets about Mr.Leonard helps Paul to belive in his-self. Paul and Mr.Leonard are just alike, neither of them can read very good. Mr.Leonard tries to help Paul become a better student and suceeds. In returning the favor Paul then starts training Mr.Leonard so he'll be able to read.
21504	8	1	1	The backgroud information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard shows him that he can acomplish something if he tries. For example when Paul and Mr. Leonard go to the track and start trianing the boy never thought he was good at anything and he always got rejected. Ended up he trained with the high school track team.
21505	8	2	2	I think Paul was shocked that a hall monitor was a college freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. And that the hall monitor 'Grabowski' couldn't read that good himself so they had something in common.
21506	8	2	2	Paul empathized with Mr. Leonard, because he knew how it felt to be the slow kid in class, and it inspired him to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
21507	8	0	0	The reader in this story happens to get many gifts. Pretty much whatever he wants is what he gets. There is not one thing the reader didnt get that he didn't want to get.
21508	8	2	2	Paul was both surprised and upset about the background information. He was surpised because he thought Mr. Leonard was just an average coach but he found out through the background information that he was wrong. He was upset because he thought Mr. Leonard trusted him enough to tell him about his past.
21509	8	1	1	After Mr. Leonard pulled out a printout of his old highschool records from track Paul seemed to be amazed! After Mr. Leonard shared to Paul that he was a great athlete,but school on the other hand didn't come easy to him; he seemed to realize that maybe Mr. Leonard is helping him because they both can relate to eachother in one way or another.
21511	8	0	0	The effect that background information has on paul is that he is not a very good student in school.
21513	8	1	1	he feels confident in the teachings mr leonard will give him in his sport of choice.
21514	8	2	2	Paul is not exactly an average boy, he doesn't really fit in and he cannot read. Mr. Leonard starts helping him in track, once Paul got a spot on the track team it was revealed to him who Mr. Leonard really was. Mr. Leonard Girabowski, a track star. He broke records and even got a scholarship to college, but it was all taken away from him because he could read. Paul could sympathize with this feeling. the embarrassment when he didn't know the answer. He was grateful for everything, so he decided to return the favor. Paul was going to teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21515	8	1	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is just like him. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to understand that branching out will help him in the long run. He does not need to be so shy. By working hard Paul can accomplish anything.
21517	8	0	0	Paul didn't know that Mr. Leonard was a college track and field athlete which affected him in som many ways.
21518	8	1	1	I think after Paul read about Mr. Leonard it pushed him harder to run and jump the hurdles, for he was also impressing him and he knew if he worked hard at it like he does with his reawding he'll be able to do it better everyday.
21519	8	1	1	The effect Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul was that Paul began to feel a connection with Mr. Leonard. In the story, Paul stated that he believed he only did the hurdles at first because he was used to obeying Mr. Leonard. However, after learning about Mr. Leonard, Paul begins to see the similarities between them. Both worked hard and excelled atheletically, but had trouble academically. These similarities make Paul empathetic toward Mr. Leonard and wish to help the man.
21520	8	1	1	Paul is somewhat bothered about how Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about him running track. I think Paul will be more motivated to be on the track team so he can impress Mr. Leonard and show him that he can overcome obstacles.
21521	8	0	0	The background information changes the way the reader looks at Mr.Leonard. He sees him now as a great athlete because he broke records in college.
21522	8	0	0	Paul now knows why he is trying to train him. Mr. Leonard wants someone that was like him in high school do better then him and have a better chance in college. not only in college but also in life.
21524	8	0	0	The background information Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard seems to discourage him. This is evident, because when he was asking Mr. Leonard about it, he looked down at the ground and his voice cracked. He felt that he had no hope since he was starting from scratch and Mr. Leonard was a star athelete in high school and college.
21525	8	0	0	The effect that this information has on Paul is tremendous becasue it shows that Mr.Leonard is a person just like him. In the story when Mr. Leonard asks Paul where he is going and he responds the learning center Mr.Leonard just srugs it off because he knows he has been there. Another example is when Mr.Leonard asks Paul to meet him after school he is trying to hepl him in life.Lastly Mr. Leonard is discuraged when he is reminded of his past but when Paul helps him he feels better.
21526	8	0	0	To let Paul now that he has to do his best in school. To have funny in sports and keep your grades up.
21528	8	0	0	The reader recieves background information about Mr. Leonard throughout the story. The reader knows that Mr. Leonard is the hall monitor and keeps the kids moving, shows an interest in students who struggle with school, and used to be a track star.         By being a hall monitor, Mr. Leonard is used to telling kids where to go and what to do. The kids in return are used to obeying him. That's why Paul never quit when Mr. Leonard made him do more work because he had been 'conditioned by hearing those words every day.'     Mr. Leonard is empathetic towards Paul because he knows what it feels like to not do well in school. He even admits to Paul the he 'lost my scholarship and flunked out'      All of these examples give background information on Mr. Leonard.
21529	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background history, Paul could relate. They both had learning problems. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn to read since Mr. Leonard helped him train for track.
21530	8	2	2	The background information makes Paul feel as though Mr. Leonard understands his problems. He says that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings well because he had often felt them. It also makes him feel as though he can give back to him. Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read as a way to repay him for his efforts.
21531	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college that ran hurdles and broke records he was stunded.  Paul confronted Mr. Leonard with the printout of web page and said what happend?  Mr. Leonard responce was 'I was a good Athlete, but not a good student.  I relied on freinds to help me but it was too hard'.  So now Paul trys harder in school and on the track.
21532	8	2	2	Whenever Paul looked up all the acheivments that Mr. Leonard made he must have been humbled to be in the presents of, what was, a star athlete. In paragraph 39, Paul seems excited and impressed with all of Leonard's success.
21534	8	1	1	He is surprised and puzzled that Mr. Leonhard didnt share the information with him. He also wants to learn more about him.
21536	8	0	0	It made him fill bad.
21538	8	1	1	I believe that Paul was encouraged to see that Mr. Leonard was once a track star, and that anyone can really reach their goals if they try hard enough. Mr. Leonard showed Paul that pushing yourself may get you to where you want to go, and in clearing the hurdles and running faster and faster each time, Paul made that push happen.
21539	8	0	0	In paragraph 44 Mr. Leonard said that his college scouts told him that his grades didn't matter. He flunked out of school and no other school wanted a runner that wouldn't read.
21540	8	0	0	They both have an issue with reading and learning well. Mr. Leonard was quick to misconstrue why Paul was in the hallway, until he brought up an obstacle in Mr. Leonards life also.
21541	8	2	2	Mr.Leonard's background infrormation has a similar effect on Paul, because he is going through the same thing, Mr. Leonard is going through. Paul goes to the Learning Center twice a week to learn how to read. Mr. Leonard was a good athlete when he was in high school but not a good student. Mr. Leonard didn't have a Learning Center back then, that would help him with his grades. So Paul understood how Mr. Leonard felt, he felt embarresed. I think Paul also felt, that he wasn't the only one going through learning diableties.
21542	8	2	2	When Paul discovers that Mr. Leaonard was a track star and that he could not read. I think that he was determined to do better.
21543	8	0	0	The effect of the background information has a very good effect in paul it makes him try to be a better person
21544	8	0	0	He was confused about why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him and why he kept his past a secret.
21546	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leanard suprises Paul. This is because what he found was this: Mr Leanard used to be a college freshman that broke records on the hurdles. He went to nationals and won the 400 meter hurdles.     Paul wasn't aware of this and asked why. Mr. Leonard didn't tell Paul because he couldn't read and flunked out of college. After that, nobody wanted a runner that could not read. Therefore, Mr. Leonard could not finish his runnning career.      This would encourage Paul to try hard to learn to read. It will show him to never give up, and always try your best in life.
21548	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard is a guy who can't read and he uesd to be a good runner for a school be because he can not read he falled but one day he helps a boy to a spot he like to do.
21549	8	1	1	he felt bad and wanted to help him out to by helping him train
21550	8	0	0	There was a very big effect from the background information given on Mr. Leonard. The biggest effect was, by Mr.Leonard sharing his past it shows that even if your not good at something, dont give up, just try even harder. Mr. Leonard said ' No other school wanted a runner who couldnt read.' As Mr. leonard says this he also is showing Paul that, hey look i was such a good athlete but just because i couldnt read, they didnt want me. Mr leonard did not want him to end up the same way.
21551	8	2	2	When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's background, he instantly begins to look up to him.  In paragraph 38, Paul lists his acheivements as a track star.  Later in the story, in paragrah 44, Mr. Leonard tells him about how he flunked out of college because he couldn't read very well.  This was something that Paul could relate to.  He knew how embarassing it could be and he wanted to repay him for all the help he had given Paul with the hurdles.
21552	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard have to look at the background of paul. Because they have the same problem . At first Paul didn't want to think about it and tell Mr. Leonard to walk back toward school. Because it was his time to start training him. And they helped each  other out and Paul realized what he did for him . They made him feel very embarrassment about it because they would call on him and he didn't want to answer amd knew everybody else was better.
21553	8	2	2	Paul is surprised that Mr.Leonard never told him about how great of a hurdler he was when he was younger. Paul sees that Mr. Leonard went on to college to hurdle and thinks that it was incredible. But then Mr.Leonard tells Paul that he wasnt a very good reader and flunked out of college because there was no learning center from him to go to for help. Paul understands how he feels and decides to help Mr.Leonard to read better since he helped him so much.
21554	8	2	2	He was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage. But at the same time, he was also curious because he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was a drop out. Paul asked, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Then they started talking about the race Mr. Leonard had won when he was a freshman in collage. Then Mr. Leonard told Paul about his school life and that he couldn't read either. And that after he was a drop out, no other collage wanted him.
21555	8	0	0	Paul is not a very good student but he is a very good athlete.
21556	8	1	1	It inspires him to try harder . Paul now knows that Mr. Leonard had the same problems he has. It showed Paul that even though it'll take work, he can learn to read and overcome that obstical in life.
21557	8	1	1	When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard he related with Mr. Leonard. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's were all too familiar to me. I knew them well...'
21558	8	2	2	Paul felt the same way because he couldnt read either. So he decided he could help Mr.Leonard out by training him.
21559	8	0	0	Tge effect causes Paul to get nerves.
21561	8	0	0	Well Mr. Leonard was a hallway protrol then he help him
21562	8	2	2	The background information that Paul got about Mr.Leonard effected him because he wanted to help him learn to read just like the learning center is helping Paul learn to read. Paul wanted to help out Mr.Leonard because he was like him he could not read but was a good athlete, and Paul didn't want to end up like him and he grew close to Mr.Leonard so he wanted to help him.
21563	8	0	0	then hes ilitereatc
21565	8	0	0	It effects Paul because at first that he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was an athlete. after Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was an athlete that changed Paul. Mr. Leonard told Paul that he wasn't good at reading at all. so, after Mr. Leonard helped Pau out with his problem. Paul helped Mr. Leonard with his problem.
21566	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard is very encouraging, he tells Paul it 'was not a bad first effort, and 'you'll do better next time.' Paul says he gets picked last all the time and is obviously effected by it because it says he didnt want to see more of that treatment out of school.  Therefore, Mr Leonard was encouraging and didn't give up on him.  This caused him to stick with it and stay confident.
21568	8	2	2	The information both shocks him and connects Paul with Mr. Leonard. They are similar since both of them arent good readers and are good at track. Paul feels like he can finally emphasize with someone for a change, and because of this Paul grows to like Mr. Leonard even more.
21569	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard feels bad for being this big track star back in school and Paul wants to make him proud.
21571	8	0	0	The background information about Mr. Leonard has a great effect on Paul because he was just like him. Paul was on his way to the Learning Center because he cant read and Mr. Leonard was a good track player like Paul but the problem was that he couldnt read either. So Mr. Leonard did not want the same thing that happened to him, happen to Paul because he knows he had something going for himself until he flunked out of college. It would probably make him proud to see Paul pick up his mistakes, run track and know how to read.
21572	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard is very powerful. It makes Paul realize that he has the chance to be good and take the next step. It allows Paul to get the chance to find help, so he can go to college and be successful.
21574	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard tells Paul, the narrator, that he had problems in school, but did great on track. He wanted to show that you can't be great at everything so easily. You have to keep trying and sooner ot later, you will accomplish the goal you were reaching for.
21576	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard reminds Paul of himself.

Then Mr. Leonard had embarrassment feelingd when Paul was called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know the answer to the question, like everybody else knew.
21580	8	1	1	im assuming that by finding out about mr. leonards past it had a great impact on pauls reading problems.

21584	8	2	2	When Paul finds out Mr. Leonards history with running he was curious why he stopped. So he asked him about it. When Mr. Leonard tells him about not being able to read and that he flunked out of high school, Paul knew how he felt. Now Paul wants to keep running, and help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
21585	8	1	1	He feels sympathtic torwards Mr. Leonard.
21586	8	0	0	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him. In paragraph 42 he explains to Paul that he is not a very good reader either and he wants to encourage him to stick to the tutoring.

They are both very good at track and neither of them can read. Paul then starts tutoring Mr. Leonard in reading while Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track.
21588	8	2	2	Paul is suprised that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about being so good at track, that is after all something a person should be proud of. Paul says 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'
21589	8	0	0	We can tell that Mr. Leonard is very well at sports and also really wants to motivate students as well. His want for motivation is what caused Paul to excel at what he does. You can tell Mr. Leonard used to be an athlete of some sort by the way he likes competition as well.
21590	8	2	2	Paul looks at Mr. Leonard with a different perspective when he learns about his past. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard when he discovers that Mr. Leonard can't read and that he flunked out of college because of that. Paul then realizes that he can train Mr. Leonard in reading just as he had been training Paul in track and field.
21591	8	1	1	When Paul read that about Grabowski it inspired him to do better. It also made him realize why Leonard had helped him and wanted him to get better at something he was not so great at to begin with.
21592	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr.  Leonard was a great athlete who couldn't make the grades to perform in college, and relates that to his personal situation. In the story, Paul showed Mr. Leonard a picture of him running in college, and tells Mr. Leonard that he knows he won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals.
21594	8	1	1	He is conserned for Mr. Leonard. Paul wants to help him because he helped Paul. Paul knows how they are alike in a way and they both need help with something. Mr. Leonard helped Paul with something and now Paul will help My. Leonard in return for helping him find some confidence in something he might be good at.
21595	8	2	2	The background information had a major effect on Paul. Paul now understood more things about his coach. Such as why, out of all people he choose Paul to work with. The reason comes from the article where Paul first meets Mr. Leonard when he is in the hall going to the Learning center and this is when Mr. Leonard compared himself to Paul and saw something in him beginning their relationship. Also getting the background information gave Paul someway to repay Mr. Leonard for what he has done and that is why he said what he said in the last paragraph, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.' Meaning that Paul was going to teach him a little bit.
21596	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a former track star, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had not told him earlier.  When Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard could not ready, just like him, he felt like they had a lot more in common with each other.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.  I knew them well --feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'  This shows that Paul is very apreciative that Mr. Leonard is showing interest in him, and it motivates him to do well in school so that he can succeed in college.
21597	8	0	0	The effect that the background information has on Paul is didn't know that Mr. Leonard had dropped out of college and he also didn't know that he got his scholarship taking away and he was really unhappy about that so Paul decided to make Mr.Leonard happy again.
21598	8	0	0	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was helping him. He realizes he needs to work hard not only on sports but on his reading, too.
21599	8	2	2	I think the infomation he got about Mr. Leonard made Paul realize that he can be normal and still be successful with his readling problem. Mr. Leonard doesn't know how to read and is helping Paul with hurdles. While Paul is gonna help Mr. Leonard read. They are helping each other with the things that are holding them back.
21600	8	2	2	Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard in many ways. Mr. Leonard sees a lot of himself in Paul and that reminds him of how he used to be. Mr. Leonard is looking out for Paul because he doesn't want the same thing to happen to Paul that he went through. He believes that Paul can do domething great. For example, after Mr. Leonard asked Paul where he was going and why, that's when he got the idea of asking him to play sports. Then he realized basketball wasn't what he liked, so he gave him a chance on the hurdles and Paul succeeded.
21601	8	2	2	In the story I obtained information about Mr. Leonard. Telling us that he can't read, such as Paul can't read.

21707	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard i'm sure that he is encouraged to do well simply because now he knows he's being coached by a talented star in his day, it's motivation. Then when he finds out that he can't read as well, i feel it motivates him even more because Mr. Leonard was a great track star that flucked college due to the lack of available help. Paul not just has the training of Mr. Leonard and the track team to help him with track, but he also has the help of the leraning center to help him read, and he can be successful if he keeps at it.
21708	8	2	2	Paul feels that Mr.Leonard should not have hidden that he couldnt read either.

He might have felt that the two of them can over come the problem together.

21710	8	1	1	Paul had almost the same background as Mr. Leonard. Paul  was going threw probems like Mr. Leonard did in school. Mr. Leonard told Paul that he could do amything only if he tried.
21711	8	0	0	The background information that Mr. Leonard told Paul let him know that there may be challenges in life. Mr. Leonard didn't make the grades but he got into college just fine. Mr. Leonard wants to hep Paul because he never got the oppurtunity to be in a learning center.
21712	8	0	0	He feels upset that Mr. Leonard didn't tell paul about his past acheivements.
21713	8	1	1	The effect that has on the paul that Mr. Leonard was a very good track runner in college. Paul didn't know Mr. Leonard got put out of school because he didn't have grade's. Mr. Leoard didn't wanna tell paul he got put out of school because of his grade's. Paul found out that Mr. Leonard can't read. Paul decdie to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21714	8	1	1	After Paul learns background information about Mr. Leonard, he realizes that they both have more in common than Paul thought. Paul knows the emotions Mr. Leonard went through, like 'feelings of emarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew' (lines 46-48). Because of the fact that Paul knows what Mr. Leonard has gone through, Paul now realizes that Mr. Leonard has given up his time to help Paul, and Paul knows now that he can help Mr. Leonard as well.
21715	8	2	2	I believe that it had a motivational effect on him. i say that because, he did'nt want Paul going through life feeling discouraged like Mr. Leonard did. He knew what it feels like to not be able to read and thats embarrassing. Another reason why i believe this had a movtivational effect on him was because he wanted Paul to have confindent in himself, and over the obstacle of not nbeing able to read.
21716	8	0	0	Paul got background information about Mr. Leonard from when he was a college student and was involved in hurdling. Paul was always chosen last for a basketball team so Mr. Leonard to Paul to the track to train him for hurdlers. I believe Mr. Leonard saw himself as Paul. In college, Mr. Leonard couldn't read and I'm sure he felt like an outsider. Therefore, Paul felt like an outsider when it came to being chosen last for a team everyday.
21717	8	2	2	Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a track star in his running days. Mr. Leonard tells him, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good enough student. We had no learning centers in our school.'This influenced Paul to work harder at both track and reading. He also wanted to assist Mr. Leonard in reading.
21719	8	1	1	It encourages him to really work hard and make Mr. Leonard proud, and try to accomplish the things that Mr. Leonard couldn't.

In paragraph 6, Paul tells Mr. Leonard that he can't read, and that is why he is going to the Learning Center. Later on in the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in hurdles as well. Paul asks why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him when he was coaching Paul. Mr. Leonard then tells Paul, in paragraph 44 lines 4-5, that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read. This connects Paul and Mr. Leonard. Paul then decides to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
21722	8	0	0	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is not vary smart. The narrator tells Mr. Leonard that it is time for his training what means that Paul is going to teach him to become better.
21724	8	2	2	The background information we learn about Mr. Leonard is a huge twist on the story. By learning that Mr. Leonard was a poor reader, we know that he and Paul have the same problem. Paul who we know can't read turns out to be a great athlete but can't read. Mr. Leonard who was a tremendous college athlete was a poor reader as well. Mr. Leonard wants to help evolve Paul into coming a better student athlete. He can't rely on his athletic skills alone to get into college.
21725	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background, that he flunked out of college, Paul was very understanding.  Paul was undergoing the exact same thing that Mr. Leonard was; Paul couldn't read.  Paul knew how it must have felt for Mr. Leonard to explain his past to Paul.  For example, in paragraph 45, the narator, Paul, says, 'I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'  In that quote, Paul explains that he went through the same thing, and feelings that Mr. Leonard was going through when he told Paul that he flunked out of college.  Paul understood clearly what Mr. Leonard felt.
21726	8	1	1	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past it makes him curious as well as determined, knowing the man who was coaching him was a star athlete. He also sees that education is just as important as sports and working hard will get you places just like Mr. Leonard worked hard at sports.

The author made a good decision by choosing to organize this article this way. It really gets the point across.
23171	9	1	1	In the article he tells us how leaving junk in space is a threat to us. By leaving so much of it in space, it makes it difficult to go to the moon for example. For we leave too much clutter in space, it can also be a threat to us from how fast it is going around the earth. how it can damage spacecraft, satalites, or other stuff that goes into space. By telling us this information, scientist can someday find a way to get rid of spacejunk. so that we can see what space is like to us.

23199	9	1	1	That objects in space can cause harmful reactions to our planet so we must reduce our activity in space. Why, risk something that can hurt the entire planet? Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere. They explore the vast reaches of our solar system, monitor atmospheric conditions, and make global wireless possible. Has had also major out comes that possibly could harm our planet in the long run.

After that, the author describes some of the things that have gone wrong in space and how they potentially could hurt us down here on Earth.  It really makes the reader think about how dangerous even the little things billions of miles above us in space could effect us here on Earth.  The author did a great job of capturing the reader's attention and then making great points about the seriousness and danger of the debris that comes from space.
23470	9	2	2	The author organizes the article first by telling us what is a space junk and what they are , satellites in the atmosphere orbiting with out control. Then Crash Course which is about dead satellites craching. Then Little Bits, But a Big Deal, this little topic is about people that are concern of the little bits of space debris that can present a very serious problem.
23471	9	1	1	He began it with an introduction that got the reader's attention and stated what the article was going to be about. Then throughout the rest of the article it has different heading that discuss the different topics, then in the conlusion he restates the problem.

23475	9	2	2	How does the author title the article, he titles is to help the reader. The first paragraph explains to the reader what space junk is, the second paragraph tells how the space junk, explained in the privious paragraph, can be of a affect on sattelites. The third explains how even the littlest bit of space junk can harm satellites or other space objests. If the author would not have explained what space junk was then the reader might be lost in the second and third paragraph, same goes with if he had not explained how alot of the debre got there then the reader might have been lost in the third paragraph. so the way he titled it by explaining what space junk was then explaing how it got so clutter and how it can have an affect was the way the aothur organised this article.
23476	9	1	1	The author starts by introducing some background information on orbital pathways. The author then describes the great space invasion and how high tech junk circles the globe in orbit.

23517	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by using paragraphs and using sub headings.
23518	9	2	2	The author organizes this article into different sections that explain about different things. The sections are named as follows: Orbiting Junk, What IS Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. Orbiting Junk refers to the items that are orbiting around the Earth; they are left over from satellite crashes or lost by astronauts. What IS Space Junk explains to the readers about what kind of items are left behind in space. The section Crash Course refers to the event of a Russian and American satellite 'running' into one another. Little Bits, But a Big Deal basically tells the audience about why and how having 'space junk' can harm the Earth.
23520	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with different sections all explaining different points.  For example, the section titled 'What Is Space Junk', simply explains the meaning and history, along with statistics of space junk.

23523	9	1	1	space junk bad for us and space it coses so many problimes like with the skin on a space ship or the wings on a satulight so in sume respectds we need to clen up space just as much as wee need to clean up earth
23525	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by giving background knowledge, then conveying the problem, and finally, giving a call to action for a solution to the problem.      In the first piece of the article, 'What Is Space Junk?' the author gives a bit of information on what he/she is about to be talking about.  The author gives the background information that the reader needs, such as 'Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere.' Then in this piece, he/she introduces the problem to readers, revealing that the satellite that malfunctions and cannot be repared, or the satellite that collided with something else 'becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit.'      In the second part of the article, 'Crash Course' the author conveys the problem, which is the overall theme of the article.  He/she even gives an example of a time when the problem occured when 'Two communications satellites, one American and one Russian, both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hour, crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth.' The author reveals that satellites can actually collide with each other, and cause space debris which can be extremely harmful.     Finally, the author calls the reader to search for a solution to this problem.  He/she conveys to the reader that, 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise' and that scientists need to come up for a solution to this problem before it becomes too large to handle.
23526	9	2	2	The author organizes the article starting with an introduction that catches the reader's attention.  The rhetorical questions are the talk about space junk will hold the reader's attention and ensure they stick around for more.  They then move into an intoduction to the space race and what space junk is.  This gives a good understanding for the reader as they continue down the article.  After that, they start with statistics that shock the reader.  That really excites the reader to reading the last paragraph.  The last few paragraphs show the impact the space junk causes, the efforts of NASA, and the fact that space junk is increasing.  This gives a nice conclusion to the paragraph.
23527	9	2	2	The way the article was organized by the authur is that; first about orbiting junk, which is objects in free orbit in space. Then it goes in to what is space junk which decribes what space junk really is. Next to crash course which decribes how the satellites crash noto one another. Then finally to little bits, but a big deal which talks about even tho the parts in fre orbit are small but they cause a big problem if they hit anything.

After this the author describes the history of space travel and the space race as well as describing what happens to technology that is broken and just floating around in space in the section 'What is Space Junk?'.  Then in the section 'Crash Course' the author describes how satellites and debris collide and the effects of the collision.  After this point the author describes the horrible impacts of small microdebris on other space ships and satellites and what engineers and scientists are doing to counteract this in the section 'Little Bits, but a Big Deal.'  Finally the author concludes that the problem is certain to persist and that the amout of space trash keeps increasing and then the author ends the article by saying that space agencies hope that corporations can come together to find a solution to the problem of space junk.

In the last paragraph, I like how it ends with this, it starts talking about how little of a thing can be such a big problem. We are starting to adjust to the space junk, instead of the space junk adjusting to us. We are changing for it instead of getting rid of the space junk.      I like how this article is structured. It gives detail and stories. It is informative as well as interesting.

Next, we move on to What Is Space Junk, which explains the history of space exploration. It also talks about the problems with this though, and how when a satellite 'dies' it just keeps going in space. That is how we get Space Junk. Next we have Crash Course, which focuses on one important crash that occured between two satellites. This is important because it talks about one main important moment when space junk really became a problem. Last, they have Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This part is the conclusion, and talks about all the problems space junk can cause. It gives us examples like in paragragh 10 about the lost tool bag. This is important because it gives us a idea of just how dangerous this is. So that is how the author organizes this well written article.

This organization technique is common in information essays. First, the problem is introduced, and from there the problem is discussed with background information, statistics, comparisons, analogies, and inferences. For example, the author uses the comparison of sand 'shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall' in the section that describes the harmful effects of small debris.

24059	9	1	1	Intro. Beginning. Middle. End. First by using shocking statements to grab your attention. Then once the reader has your attention he/she provides you which researched information and the hard facts. After providing the facts he/she explains the various problems space junk can create. Lastly he/she leaves you with a few things to think about.
24060	9	2	2	The author of this article organizes it in a very intelligent way.  First the author begins with an introduction that captures the attention of the reader. Other than the beginning title the author also includes subtitles or headings. The author uses three different headings to divide the different pieces of information into the same categories. The subtitles are organized in a way that helps grow on the seriousness of 'space junk.' this can simply be seen through the subtitles themselves; What is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
24061	9	1	1	The article is organized under different headings and the headings are explained.  Also, the years of different facts go in chronological order.
24062	9	1	1	The author starts out with surprising statements to alarm the reader and to make them attentive. The author also has the titles of each section titled appropriately and accuratly to help us understand the seriousness of trash in space. We take space for granted most of the time and we have no idea of the dangers of the junk up there that can actually do harm to earth itself.
24063	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by starting off with the question' 'What Is Space Junk?' In the two paragraphs the author explains about history of going into space. Then there is another title, 'Crash Course'. Those two paragraphs explain satellites crashing into each other. Then there is another titled' 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' Those three paragraphs explain the floating lost things in space.
24064	9	2	2	The author organized the article, 'Orbiting Junk' by adding different sections of reading.  In saying sections, I am referring to the titles through out the article.  'What Is Space Junk?''Crash Course' 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'Those titles are all examples of how the author organized his article.
24065	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in a simple, yet effective way. They have chosen one main point, which is space junk, and created a few subtopics. By doing this, they have made it simple to stay on topic and still learn about different aspects of the problem.     The article begins by telling the audience what problem they are going to elaborate on, which is orbiting junk. Next, they answer the question that many of us may be asking ourselves. What is space junk? Well, after reading the second paragraph, we know what that is. After this, we are educated on risks of crashes and collisions with the junk that is orbiting in our solar system. Last of all, we read that no matter how small the object is, it can have a large impact on other objects in the atmosphere.      Because these smaller topics are separated from each other, the reader can maintain their attention while reading of the many different factors of space junk.
24066	9	1	1	The author writes this article so that the term 'space junk' is explained in the beginning.  The process of the object becoming a space junk is explained in the beginning followed by the dangers that occur because of it.  This article is organized so that the reader is informed about space debris little by little.  After being informed on how the 'dead' object can cause harm, the reader then learns about why space pollution is becoming a major problem.       The way this article is organized helps the readers be informed on space pollution without recieving too many information at once.  The article is divided into sections then paragraphs, allowing the reader to understand more easily the information that is being given to them.

For example, he/she use the transition form the main title 'Orbiting Junk,' to 'What is Space Junk.' These sections describe what 'space junk' is. Then he/she transition into the dangfers of 'space junck,' by using titles such as 'Crash Course,' which transitions into 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' these sections demenstrate the dangers of colliding sattilites. The author organized his/her selection in a way that flows from one point to the next.

The author ends the passage by describing the dangers of these pieces of debris, stating that the objects in space are similar to '...[sand] shot from a sandblaster...'  The author concludes his passage with a tone of resolution; he hopes that solutions can be created to stop this growing problem.
24080	9	1	1	The author divides each different part about orbiting junk into their own sections. The author doesn't fuse his or work together.
24082	9	1	1	First the author started talking about the basic information about the space junk and then he wrote what it is use for and also talked abour all rhe dangerous and safety thins about the space junk.
24083	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in catagories as to help the reader understand the article better.

24134	9	2	2	The author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction, and three sub topics.  I agree that 'space junk' could become a big problem.  I feel this way because the qoute, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  That qoute shows that even small subtances can cause a lot of harm if it has enough force, and something falling back to earth from space would have a ton of force.
24135	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by giving information about space junk, then talking about dead satellites and there risk of colliding with each other.

Then, he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph. The ending paragraph in that section, talking about dead satellites circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit, leads to the next main point, Crash Course. That talks about the American and Russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path. Also, it says that accidents do happen, and gives an example on an astronaut loosing grip of a tool bag while doing repairs on the International Space Station. This leads into Little Bits, But a Big Deal. In this paragraph, it says so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash? This leads into the subject that many people do, infact, care. It then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion.

This is followed by the section Crash Course which explains how space junk causes collisions in orbit. The next section emphasizes the damage this space junk can cause to space crafts and other research satellites. The ending is also very well thought out restatign the problem and showing how it is an increasing problem. I liked this article and thought it was very well organized by the author.
24345	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by using different sections. The article uses the section 'What Is Space Juck?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' The cause for this is to have everything more organized.

24351	9	1	1	The author starts the article with a fun attention getter, and then swtiches to a more serious organized fashion of writing. It is split into 4 detailed topics that explain space junk.
24352	9	2	2	The author organizes this piece very well do to the fact that everything is titled and is in there own little section.  For example when they talk about the debres crashing into things they placed that in the crash course section of the piece.
24353	9	2	2	In the article 'Orbiting Junk', the author arranges the artcile in a logical sense - He starts out with the introduction, which uses rhetorical questions and well known phrases to grab your attention. He then moves on to inform you of the main problem of 'space junk' with his primary thesis. The next section the author writes is 'What Is Space Junk?', and this section has one major goal - to inform us readers with the definition of space junk. In addition, the author provides use with facts that show the length of time space 'junk' can exist in orbit. 'The objects themselves, however, are positioned hundreds of miles above Earth, far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up'. The next section is Crash Course - this section shows how space junk gets into the atmosphere, through the examples of American/Russian satellites colliding with each other, or an astronaut accidently releasing a tool bag. The next section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', focuses on the hard hitting truth - that space debris can cause severe damage to space shuttles and astronauts. The author shows how undetectable pieces of debris, also known as microdebris, can cause sigfnifigant damage through the comparison to the sand particles used in a sandblaster. The author closes his article with his conclusion - that space trash is increasing in volumn and size because of commerical space travel and how we need to undertake a solution to space pollution.
24354	9	2	2	The author seperates the article into a build up/introduction, and then different potential issues that can arise from space junk.  The introduction goes along with 'What Is Space Junk?'(Build up). And the other sections are issues arisin due to space junk.
24355	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by splitting up the diffrent sections of the diffrent serious matters. There's the space junk, and the reasons for it being there, and how unnecessary it is.

24357	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first grabbing the reader's attention with the sentence 'Grab your telescope!  Look up in the sky!  It's a comet!  It's a meteor!  It's a...tool bag?'.  This passage is interesting and makes the reader want to read more.  Then the reader is told that this can actually happen and that this article is going to be about space junk.  Next the reader learns what makes up space junk and why it is there.  The article explains how the space junk is the stuff that doesn't fall back to earth, so it isn't burned up in the atmosphere.  Instead it floats around in space.  The article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk.  In the next section, crash course, we are told why satellites can be considered space junk and what happens when they collide.  We also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space.  But by now the reader is wondering why this matters and what problems could come from these little bits of debris.  The author brings us to the answer with the section little bits, but a big deal.  This section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems.  A useful metaphor of sand and sandblasters is used here to put this problem into a perspective that can be understood easier by the general public.  Lastly, the article explains what is being done about this problem.  So, in a more general form we are hooked into the story, then given a problem, then the problem is explained in more detail, then we are told why it's a problem, and lastly what solutions are out there and what is being done to solve this problem.  This method of organization ensures that the reader is never confused, and is given the information in a logical order, answering the reader's questions directly as they come.

From this he begins explaining exactly what space junk is and when it first appeared in the atmosphere above space. After that he gives a past event from February 2009 and in 2008 as examples of how space junk occurs. Next he describes the severity of these space crashes by using details such as comparing 'grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  This comparison was used very well because it helps create an image of how bad it is when two satelites in space collide. Finally the author closes his article by telling the reader how big of a problem space junk is becoming and how space agencies are beginning to work together to put a stop to it.
24519	9	1	1	The author starts off with telling us what space junk is.

24524	9	1	1	He organizes it into different storys with different titles.
24525	9	1	1	I believe is in chronological order according to years. In the very section after the introduction, it says in 1957. After that it gradually progresses to present day. The author also would explain the major problems in the past, and work his way up to explaining our modern day problems. For example, the author talked about 'Space Junk' in 1957, and later in the article about satellites crashing into one another in 2009.
24526	9	2	2	The author uses many different sections that split up all that he has to say.  If he didn't conduct the article this way then he would have trouble trying to meld all of his writing together such as the part about Orbiting Junk and Crash Course.  The two of them would not go together very well without the seperation of the sections.
24527	9	0	0	That there is too much junk up in space and the more and more they get is just going to make everything go wrong and soon everything will start to crash.

24529	9	2	2	At first the author brings you in with starting sentence. After that he explains how serious space junk really is, then goes on and tells about the space invansion between the countries.     But the last and maybe most important thing, is the microdebris fields, the military can not detect anything smaller then a baseball. While people may thing a baseball is small, and can still hurt our spacecrafts and put our sattelites in danger.
24530	9	2	2	The author starts out with an introduction paragraph that was written in a way to grab the reader's attention and get them to keep reading. It's written in an almost comical way by using a phrase that many people have heard before, which is the first sentence in reference to the famous 'Superman' line. Then it goes on to paragraph to that is used to explain to the reader just what the rest of the article is going to be about and give a little background information on it. It gives facts about how satellites were started and how space junk is formed. Then it moves on to explain the dangers of this space junk in paragraph 6-7 titled,'Crash Course.' It explains that anything left up in space can become a danger for other satellites. The risks and dangers are further explained in, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' This part explains how even though something can be so small and may be thought of as not a very big deal, it can still cause a lot of damage. It gives the sand example that says that something going at very high speeds can still cause a lot of damage. It concludes by saying that there are ways to prevent space junk by countries working together to come up with a soluting to this problem.
24531	9	1	1	The author first defines what satelittes and space crafts are and why they are launched into space, then explains how the microdebri effect them. The author backs it up with detail and specific information and findings.

24533	9	1	1	The author first starts off by telling what the problem is. The problem is space junk. The author explains exactly what this 'junk' is. The author then gives a history of space exploration. I think that is important because it shows that after 50 years there could be a lot of junk built up. The important thing is they realize its a problem; that is explained in the last section. They're trying to find ways to solve this problem.
24534	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by telling what space junk is first. By doing that you know what it is and how it got up there in the first place. After that they tell you about the crash course. In that it tells you how and why the space junk crashes into one another. Then after they tell you about that, they tell you how unsafe little bits are. Within that it tells you how even the smallest thing can cause a big problem out in space.
24535	9	1	1	The author organizes this article by title names for each topic in the article, to break down each topic so it is easier to read.

Crash Course. This paragraph talks about how satellites haved crash in space. Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This talks about how little thing that get lost in space like tools from astronauts get lost in space and which can cause a lot of damage.
24538	9	2	2	He organizes it in different catogories suck as what space junk is, what happens when stuff crashes and how it affects and how tose peices may be small but they can still affect in a huge way.

24545	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by beginning with a attention getter such as, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' Then moves onto explaining in the first part of the body what exactly Space Junk is and how it can affect us. An example would be,'what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfuunctions and can't be repaired?' Of course the answer to that it's disbaled and becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit. The second part of the body it is described that if a satellite is malfunctioning it has the risk of colliding with another satellite. From paragraph six it explains that two communication satellites one American and one Russian, both traveling more than 20,000 mph. crashed into each other 491 mi. above the Earth. The main purpose of the next and final part of this author's article is tiny bits of space debris and how it can be a serious problem. Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts. Here is an example form paragraph nine that supports this statement, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.' All in all the author explains in paragraph eleven that the problem still persists and that the amount of space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is rising.
24546	9	2	2	The article is a well organized piece. It starts out with grabbing the attention of the reader and then presents the problem that 'space junk' is a serious matter that needs to be brought to more people's attention. It then goes in to defining what 'space junk' is, as well as the 'great space invasion.' In the third section, it gives examples of how it is harmful to our planet and what really goes on when we send satellites in to outer space. Finally in the last section, it states that they are again a serious problem and reitterates everything that the article is about. It also presents a solution.
24547	9	1	1	The author starts out the article with excitement and makes the reader more interested in this passage.  He organized it by starting out with what was seen in the sky that you don't see everyday.  He's got different titles which talk about what exactly is in the sky on this earth that we don't normally see such as space junk and what it is.  He then goes into talk about how the space junk causes crashes and the harm that it has.  Then he goes into talking about how even if it's little particles that aren't very big, can still cause serious damage due to the the speed of the spacecraft and what it runs into.

He or she begins with a creative introduction to engage the reader, then proceeds to lead right into the main idea: space junk. He mentions the objects that have been sent into Eath's atmosphere and branches off the problem of satellites, and what happens when it malfunctions. He concludes this with the fact that this object will become space junk. This leads into the next paragraph where he explains problems that 'dead' satellites cause, and so on. The author continues to tie eveything together in this particular order throughout the entire passage.
24653	9	1	1	The author organizes this article by grouping different information together. Under 'What Is Space Junk?', an explanation is given of what it is. Under 'Crash Course', the author talks about examples of when space debris has become a problem to space exploration.
24654	9	2	2	The author of the article organizes the writing in a logical way. They first describe what space junk is in 'What Is Space Junk?'. They do this by giving a short history on the space invasion and a short explanation on how a satellite can 'die' and hurtle uncontrolably through space. Then the author goes on to explain how space junk is created in the section 'Crash Course'. They explain how satelittes can collide and create massive amounts of microdebris that continue to orbit the Earth at incredible speeds. They also show how some astronauts can make mistakes such as losing the grip on their tool bag and causing the bag to begin orbiting the earth.

Although it is very long it toke a very complicated matter and put it into a simple form fo readers that are at a young age to fully understane the importance in space junk.
24661	9	1	1	It is organized into sections on the junk in outer space.  They are telling you that it can be a very dangerous matter.  Each section is about different things.  Space trash is still increasing these days.  Without anyone at the controls dead satellites could collide with each other.
24662	9	0	0	The author does ok. The author's reference to the tool bag in the first paragraph, isn't talked about again untill about two paragraphs later. I, as the reader, had no clue what the author meant by tool bag untill the end of the second topic.
24663	9	2	2	The author of this article starts with an introduction that states once clear space is 'now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions.'

24668	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by talking about the junk that is orbiting space now then explaning space junk to people who dont know what it is, and then after that explaining the harm and or problems that the junk could have on earth and even the people who travel out to space.
24670	9	2	2	The author organizes the article much like one would see in a magazine. It includes headings with short paragraghes under them. The point of the article is made very clear in a short amount of space with many imperative facts and details. They make it interesting by giving each heading an apealing name such as 'Crash Course,' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
24671	9	1	1	The author breaks up the artical into three different parts. He does that so that you can understand what the artical is talking about.

24672	9	2	2	the author organizes the article as a cause and effect article.  The author first talks about satellites being launched into orbit, 'Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere.'  Then describes how these satellites can malfunction or become damaged. Then the author descirbes how these malfunctioned and damaged satellites can collide and produce space junk. 'Now, instead of two disabled satellites, there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space.'
24673	9	1	1	he gets the tittle on what he want to wright about then he goes and tittles the story haedings.
24674	9	1	1	I would say that the author organized this passage in a way of most important and which came first. In the passage 'What Is Space Junk', it talks about how satelites began and the last passage 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal',
24675	9	1	1	The author organizes this article great. He drew me in by the introdtuction. The author also had very good detail on space junk and he had had an excellent body. The author really did a great job on organizing his article.
24677	9	0	0	By puting the stories in the right order on how it would happen first.
24679	9	0	0	he gives lots of information throughout the article.
24680	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by building up information. He starts off with how it all started by explaining what space junk is. Then he tells us how sattelites will eventually crash into each other. Finally, he axplains how the results of those crashes will create debris that can cause a big problem with the Earth.
24681	9	2	2	The Author organizes this article in three different sections. They start off by explaining what they are going to be talking about, space junk. Then they go on to give one way that space junk is effective and what it does to our outer space. Finally the author tells us about how even though space junk is very small and not many know about it or realize, it is very effective.
24682	9	1	1	The author organizes this article by events that lead up to what his main topic is. he starts with the first artificial satellite and end with all the space trash in outer space now.
24683	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first, grabbing our attention in an artful, playful manner (Lines 1-2). The author then goes on to explain how space junk is created, although in a much more serious manner. Once the reader is clear on the causes of 'space junk', the author goes in-depth on what happens to these unwanted fragments, in the way of collissions, and free-orbiting satellites. Eventually, the author concludes how these little pieces of 'space trash' become dangerous to future foreys into the field of space travel, and advises that we seek a 'viable sollution'.
24684	9	1	1	The author explains a story first for an example then he goes to his point. He tells wat space junk is then he tells why it is harfull even if we think it is not. He does this when he talks about stuff hitting each other in there orbit and when a simple toolbag could cause a problem.
24685	9	0	0	First the author tills you what the article is all about then the author tills you the dangers of it.
24686	9	1	1	The author starts out interseting.  Then they give us statistics about what has happened in the past years.  Around the sixth paragraph they give us examples.  By the eighth and ninth paragraphs they are talking about the bag, which was mentioned in the introduction.  The conclusion of this passage is saying that they hope to one day come up with a sollution to this.
24687	9	2	2	The just use thing they know and but things where they belong. Like 'What is Space Junk' it explains to you what it is tells you everything they know baout the topic writen about the statements. They always look to make sure the things they have out in the passage makes sence with the topic it is under. They never put things that makes no sence in a passage like if they but and there was a bananas are monkey favorite food in there under 'What is Space Junk' it just dosent fit. They only use things that are clear and you help you to understand about the thing they are writing about.
24689	9	0	0	because it gives you a lead in what happenend or what it that.
24690	9	2	2	The auther sets up the article in sections from describing what space junk is and how harmful it can be
24691	9	1	1	IN SECTIONS SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC ANSWER TO A QUESTION YOU JUST LOOK UNDER THE TOPIC IT MAY BE UNDER.
24692	9	2	2	The article is organized by first giving a history about space exploration an example being when the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite and how the United States followed along behind them. Next you are told about how things in an uncontrolled orbit collide with each other, functioning satellites, and even space ships. In the last section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' you are informed that even though the space debris is small is can be dangerous. For example, even an object small than a baseball traveling at high speeds can cause large amounts of damage to satellites and space crafts. The overall organization of this starts off to tell you a history, give you examples, and detail problems that 'space junk' can cause.
24693	9	1	1	He organize it in diffrent topics in the story. Like one topic is 'orbiting junk' and the next one is 'what space is' so he switchis off on diffrent topics. witch i think keeps you more intested in the story cause theres diffrent topics.
24695	9	0	0	The author  believes that there needs to be less material in space. Eventualy they will all break down and fall into the earths atmosphere poluting it.
24697	9	2	2	The article starts off with a childish realization through a telescope.  Then it gives a brief history of space exploration, and a couple incidents of space debris; including the 2009 satellite crash and the toolbag.  It then comes out and tells you how big of a problem things from a toolbag to destroyed satellites by telling you about a sandblaster and how it works and using it as a larger scale for objects in orbit.
24698	9	0	0	He tells people how their is junk from the satelites hitting each other and that their is junk every where in the orbits.
24699	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by sepreating the article into sections. The first section is called Orbiting Junk. The second is called What is space junk? The third is called Crash course. The fourth is called Little Bits, but a Big Deal. They break up these articles to seperate the different points of the article. So its not all in one combination.
24701	9	1	1	The author organized his writing by sectioning his writing off.
24702	9	2	2	He starts out as, describing space junk. Than he goes to crash course, and tells the reader if something extremely bad happens this is the approch. Than last he talks about space trash. He describes the outter space, with all of the trash floating around in it, from previous astronotes.      He goes into great detail about everything that he talks about, but also its not drawn out to where you fall asleep reading it. The author did a really good job of writing this article.
24703	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by seperating the facts of everything.  The facts that he talked about include, the clutter in space, and when they launched the first artificial satellite and space junk got started, and who is going to take responsibility for the space trash.
24704	9	2	2	The author organized the article with an introduction to the subject of the articles comes first. Then the author gives background information about the subject by talking about space programs and how space debris is created. It also presents some of the problems caused by space junk. The second to last section talks about the details of how some other forms of space junk occur, as well as how hard it is to prevent space junk from occuring. The final paragraph explains how space junk can damage ships, and how ships cannot avoid it easily. The article ends with a call to corporations to help solve the problem of space junk.
24705	9	2	2	The first paragraph is to get the readers attention, and make them want to read the story. Then the tone changes in the section 'What Is Space Junk?' and because more serious. This section tells the reader what space junk is and how it got to be where it it.     The next section is called 'Crash Course' and it tells about what happens when two pieces of space junk collide, and it gives example of this happening in February 2009 with two communication satellites.     Section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is the last section, and it tells about how space junk is harmful and why this is such a serious matter. The section discusses how harmful little pices of junk can be for astronauts, and our space crafts that we send into space. The last paragraph tells about how spacejunk is increasing, and is still a problem. All nations are trying to work together to find a solution to the problem.
24706	9	0	0	The author organizes the article by the development of space technology and the dates in which the statistics of space junk; staelites, telescopes and ect, are reconized.
24707	9	1	1	The author uses titles before it opens up new information. For example one of the titles is Orbiting Junk, after that the author explains with information.
24708	9	1	1	The author first used a hook to catch the reader's attention by using a question. Then he explained what space junk was, how satellites can crash into each other, how space debris is a big deal, how space debris is harmful, and how they are trying to come up with a solution for it.
24709	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by giving you information about the junk and a time when an actual space invasion occured. Then the article goes into how people might think its not a big deal but it is.
24710	9	2	2	The author organized the article by separating information into several different sections. First, he/she explained what space debris is in 'What Is Space Junk?'. Secondly, he/she used an example of the negative effects that space debris has caused to space in ' Crash Course'.Then finally, they use information from space agencies around the world to show the effects on the countries on Earth in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
24711	9	0	0	IT WAS NOT ORGANIZED WELL
24713	9	1	1	The author oraginizes the article in varies ways. He first gets our attention by using questions and loud statements to get our attnetion. Then he shows us the harm in space junk and gives us facts about the way we are taking care of the atmosphere. THen he leads us to the end where he tells us what we can do to avooid harmful situations and gives us tips on how to improve our wasteful tendencies.
24715	9	2	2	The other orginizes this article by starting off with a introduction that gets you attention. Then is gives a brief history entitled 'What Is Space Junk?'. After that secton it moves onto  a more recent accident with space junk, and finishes the article off with the dangers of the little debri.
24716	9	2	2	The author of 'Orbiting Junk' organizes his article into several subtopics so that the reader can clearly see the change of subjects in the article making it easier to read. The subtopic 'What Is Space Junk' talks about and defines what space junk really is, while 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' talks about the relavence of space junk and its effect on space travel.
24717	9	1	1	He grabs your attention with a little action. Then he explains what space junk is and it can damage space things. How little things make a big deal.
24718	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in such a way the reader can follow along easily, without much confusion. Before he/she goes on to inform you about the trouble space junk is causing, they inform you what space junk is. Then they inform you of some of the things that are happening because of space junk, as in satellites crashing together. And they conclude by telling how big of a problem space junk has been and will be, because 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing.'
24719	9	1	1	The author organizes it into different subsections based of what the subject of the section is
24720	9	2	2	First, the author talks about Space junk and tells wehen the first artificial satellite was launched. Then, the author talks about how this ''space junk'' is currently of great concern to the government agencies.
24721	9	1	1	The author puts this article in a weird way, He or she starts by a eye catching introduction and then goes to a boring history lesson about satelittes and space junk. Then the author takes us into another exciting paragraph about satelittes crashing into each other and it just goes on and on until the article is over but somehow at the end of it all i still wanted to know more.
24723	9	1	1	The author organizes the article but making side headings of the more important things about space and space junk and orginizing information to go into those areas.
24724	9	2	2	The organization of the article is information in each section, while collectively, the sections map out a situation that could cause 'space junk.' The introduction, which obviously introduces the topic and provides a summary of the sections yet to come is followed by 'What is Space Junk' immediately afterword. Before defining space junk, a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced. The idea of an object malfunctioning is given, and an actual example of the space junk causing problems is conceived while still keeping a linear outline of the mostly informative article. Following the history of the satellites in space and their possible malfunctioning, 'Crash Course' provides an example from February 2009 shows how two satellites could collide and created hundreds of pieces of smaller debris which is elaborated in the final section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The small pieces of debris or the example given in 'Crash Course' of a tool bag are shown to be problematic and with both facts and descripitive paragraphs the informative article becomes somewhat of a story by saying,     'Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.' This section almost serves as a conclusion to the situation in which the space junk can be harmful. The organization of the article is both informative in some paragraphs but simultaneously follows a linear, yet non-descript situational plot.
24726	9	2	2	The author seperates the article into different sections that have information that goes along with cooresponding information in each of the sections. For example in the section crash course there is a detailed explanation of how two satellites collided in 2009. In the section it first tells the reader what could possibly happen and then gives an example or a possible scenario.In another example the author titles a section 'What Is Space Junk?' The author tells of how 52 years of space exploration has polluted the space just outside Earth's atmosphere. Then the author describes what the kinds of 'junk' are found in space from these previous space missions.
24727	9	1	1	The author organized this to where he could draw attention to the passage. Starting with the rehtorical questions, then describing space junk. Telling the reader how it got there, and what peoples reaction is to the space junk.
24728	9	2	2	The author seems to organize the article with a clearly defined introduction that is titled 'Orbiting Junk' that is used to introduce the subject. The author then uses two sections to explain what 'space junk' is and why it is such a big danger. He then proceeds to have a conclusion section titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', which explains why such small pieces of debris can prove to be very harmful.
24729	9	2	2	The introduction of this article grabs your attention and makes you want to read more about it. 'What is Space Junk?' describes the events that have occured overtime with the mircodebris and satelliates in space. 'Crash Course' tells about how two satellites collided into each other in an orbit around the Earth's orbit. It also tells that not only is it spectacular crashes that create this debris, it's ANY object. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' tell about how much people truly care about what's going on in space. It also tells about how dangerous microdebris can be if not avoided.
24731	9	1	1	The author organizes the article in a way were the reader first recieves information on what space junk really is, then the harmful consequences Earth could face when two satellites do collide.
24732	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by putting the same subjects together into paragraphs and different topics in different paragraphs.
24733	9	0	0	FROM FUN NEWS TO REALLY BAD INFORMATION ABOUT TODAY OUTTER SPACE
24734	9	2	2	The author starts off the passage with a comical line, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a . . . tool bag?' From their the author begins explaining the term 'space junk' and some space travel history as to how space debris came to be. Further on, the author switches tones to explain how serious this space junk can be. He provides an exapmle of when two satellites, one Russian and one American, collided in space and created hundreds of pieces that now helplessly oribit earth. Then he makes a comparison with how dangerous and affective sand can be when shot at such a fast rate. He does this to prove that even the smallest fo space junk can pose a threat to space ships entering space.
24736	9	1	1	He organizes it by getting the readers attention by starting it with a shocking sentence, then he casually starts explaining how dangerous space junk really is.
24737	9	2	2	The author does an excellent job at ordering the information of this article. They begin with an attention-getter in the opening paragraph to grab the reader's attention, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky!', then move into describing the topic of their article, space junk, more clearly, 'The disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk...' The following paragraphs explain how space junk comes to be, 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other', and the article closes with the dangers of space junk, 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.'
24738	9	2	2	The author of 'Orbiting Junk' organizes the article into four sections.  The introduction brings up the idea of space junk and explains that it is causing a global governmental concern.  The author goes on to explain what space junk is and transitions into why it is a problem in the next two paragraphs.  Finally, the author wants to raise awareness that the volume of space trash is in fact increasing and that it is difficult to avoid.
24739	9	1	1	They organize it by using ancadotes as the introductions then breaking down the article into sections that discuss the different topics.

24749	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into several sections: the intro, 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The first section defines 'space junk' for the reader. Section two explains how debris can be formed by colliding satellites, and section three explains why space junk is a problem.
25949	10	2	2	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog. iknow this because in the resul ts black got the hottest.
25950	10	1	1	white :: White because you wouldn't want the dog to ge t to hot.
25951	10	2	2	white :: the color white will reflect the suns rays of f of it because in the lab the color white had the lowest tempeture, and black absorbed the heat so it was hotter and if they had the doghouse pai nted black the dog would get to hot and die. so white
25952	10	1	1	white :: this color will keep the dog house cooler ins ide because it doesn't heat up as fast. the average time for the glass to heat up was 42 degrees in 10 minutes.
25953	10	2	2	white :: I would use a light color like White in this case because if its 95 degrees outside and you have a black dog house the dog house is going to be hot.Like in the experiment they used they used a black lid because it would make the jar the hotest.
25956	10	1	1	black ::  the color would absorb more heat from the sun making it hotter in the doghouse
25957	10	1	1	light gray :: i chose light gray because i was thinking of temperatures of the seasons. in summer the light gray will reflect some o f the heat while keeping it alittle warm inside, in winter the ligh t gray will absorb alittle of the sun light making it alittle warm inside .
25958	10	2	2	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to ho t because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the w hite lid had an averge of 42 degrees. There for if the dog house was pain ted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot inside.
25959	10	2	2	black ::  The black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside. The average temperature with the black lid was 53(DEG), the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG). The average temp erature for the light gray was 45(DEG) and for the white it was 42(DEG) . There is a 11(DEG) difference between the black and white colored lid. So the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside.
25960	10	0	0	white :: the color white will reflect the sunlight just like the white lid reflected the light from the lamp in the experiment.
25961	10	1	1	white ::  it would reflect a lot of the light and heat making it cooler inside the doghouse.
25962	10	1	1	white :: it will give the dog more cool air because li ghter colors absorb cool air instead of heat
25966	10	1	1	black :: it will keep the inside of the dog house warm er
25968	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint becau se in the experiment, the jar with the white lid increased the least in t emperature. It increased 18(DEG)C while the black lid made the temperatu re increase 29(DEG)C. Therefore, the white paint should be used so that the dog house doesn't overheat.
25969	10	1	1	white :: The color white would affect the doghouse it so it may be cooler inside because of the lack in absorbing energy.
25970	10	0	0	light gray :: on cold days the light gray absorbs the hotte r temp. and on hot days it douse not absorb as much.
25971	10	2	2	white ::  The best color to paint the dog house would b e white. White reflects more light than black. This would keep the inside temperature of the dog house cooler than it would if the dog house were painted black. In the experiment, the white lid was at an average of 11(DEG) C cooler than the jar with the black lid. Therefore, the white would be the bes t color to paint the dog house.
25972	10	1	1	light gray :: the doghouse should be light gray because it does not absorb to much heat or to little heat so the dog won't be to hot or to cold it will be just right
25973	10	2	2	white :: If they colored the doghouse white then it wi ll be cool inside and not so hot like it would be if it was black. Because when the jar lid was black the inside of the jar was 53(DEG)C an d when it was white the inside of the jar was 42(DEG)C
25974	10	1	1	dark gray :: The air inside will be hotter than it would b e with the light gray and white as the roof color so the dog can stay war m at night but it also be colder than if the black was the roof color so the dog won't get too hot during the day.
25976	10	2	2	black :: It will effect the dog house by it being more hot cause on the chart it showed black was the hottest
25977	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray color would reflect some of th e light energy, but also absorb a little so the doghouse would not get to o hot or cold. The white color had an average of 42(DEG)C after 10 minut es, which might be too cold. The dark gray had an average of 48(DEG)C, w hich might be too hot.
25978	10	0	0	black :: no color will affect the doghouse
25979	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use because it would not be too hot inside. If you were to do black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb more heat. In every trial for dark gray it created 48(DEG)C. This seems like a pretty good temperature for a dog house.
25981	10	0	0	black ::  I chose black because the sun wont reflect th e color black and it wont effect inside the dog house.
25982	10	1	1	white ::  It will make the dog house cooler
25983	10	0	0	black :: because it's so string
25984	10	1	1	white ::  It should be white. The white lid average was 42(DEG)C and it was the lowest average of temperature for the experimen t.
25985	10	1	1	white :: The white color reflected the most thermal en ergy and will keep the dog cool.
25986	10	1	1	dark gray ::  It will make it warmer than a light grey or w hite doghouse, but cooler than a black doghouse. This is better because d ogs generally use a doghouse to hide from the rain in winter, and my colo r will keep it warmer. However, they are also used in summer, and as such should not be black, as that would make it unusable during summer.
25987	10	1	1	black :: The black doghouse would keep you warmer in t he winter but it would be really hot in the summer
25988	10	1	1	white :: the color will keep the dog house cool on the inside so on hot summer days the dogs can be nice and cool
25989	10	2	2	black ::  Black paint would affect the doghouse by making it the warmest because according to the data black had the highest average of temperature which was 53(DEG)C, which is warmer than the other 3 tested colors. So to me I think black would be the best color.
25990	10	0	0	light gray ::  I chose light gray becasue it won't make the dog feel sad.
25991	10	2	2	light gray ::  The light gray color would keep the doghouse mild and warm. On average, the light gray colored lid went from 24(DEG) C to 42(DEG) C (a difference of 21(DEG) C). Compared to the black color ed lid, which went from 24(DEG) C to 53(DEG) C (a difference of 29(DEG) C, which is too hot). Or the white colored lid which went from 24(DEG) C to 4 2(DEG) C (a difference of 18(DEG) C). Therefore, a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse.
25992	10	2	2	white :: white will keep the dog house nice and cool s ince according to there data the white lid kept the air in the jar cooles t.
25993	10	2	2	black :: the black one will have a good heat for the d og because in the trial the black lid was average was 53 (DEG)c .
25994	10	1	1	white :: the color of the dog house will affect the te mperature of the inside of the dog house. the color white will keep the t emerature lower than the other colors.
25995	10	2	2	light gray ::  I think white would be the best color for the doghouse becuase according to the experiment it was the coldest so in th e summer when it is hot outside the doghouse will not be to hot.
25996	10	1	1	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse white because the color absorbs less heat, so it will keep it cool and no t too hot for the doggy.
25997	10	1	1	light gray :: It wont be to hot on sunny days and it wont be to cold on cloudy days.
25998	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for the doghous e because it would keep the dog cooler. White would absorb less solar and thermal energy, therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse. In the experiment, the air temperature in the jar with the white lid aver aged 42(DEG) C, while the black lid jar averaged 53(DEG) C. The light g ray lid produced and air temperature of 45(DEG) C and the dark gray lid made the air temperature in the jar 48(DEG) C.
25999	10	2	2	black :: Black will make the dog house warmer inside b ecause darker colors absorb more energy. And in "Air Temperature" the average temp. for black was 53(DEG), while the average for white was 42(DEG) . Every starting temperature started at 24(DEG), therfore, black would be the best color to choose for the dog house.
26000	10	2	2	black ::  black will be the based color for the dog hou es because.In the chart "lid color vs.Air temperture Inside Glass Ja r"black hade 54 in trial 1and52 in trial 2 and 53 in trail 3.Dark gr ay,Light gyay,and White where in the low to high 40's.black will keep the dog house warm or cool when needed.
26001	10	1	1	light gray :: The color light gray will affect the inside o f the dog house because it will get warm but not too hot because if you h ave a dog house that is way to hot the dog might die and since dog houses are always out in the sun the dog house will become extremely hot becaus e in the experiment the lid colors were only left under a lamp for about only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly.
26002	10	2	2	white :: Using white paint would be a great paint colo r for the doghouse because if its white it won't recieve that much sunlig ht and so it would be cooler. If you look at the data table it would show you that when it has white paint it is below 45(DEG)c so white would be a great doghouse color.
26003	10	1	1	white :: Because white does not asborb as much energy so it would be cooler in the dog house.
26004	10	2	2	black :: If Brandi and Jerry use black, then the tempe rature will be warmer, because it has the highest average temperature at 53(DEG)C.If they use white, then it will bne colder, because the average when white was 42(DEG)C. Therefore the darker the doghouse the warmer i t will be because black was 11(DEG)C more than white.
26005	10	1	1	white ::  the white colored paint might make the inside o the dog house colder than out side on a hot day s ohe or she dont get way to hot.
26006	10	1	1	light gray :: It would be a good color because it wouldnt b e too cold or too hot for the dog. it would be just right.
26008	10	1	1	black :: Because the doghouse will have a higher tempe rature because black absorbs more solar energy, which will transform into thermal energy
26010	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose a darker color like dark gray, becasu e it will absorb more energy so the dog will hopefully much warmer in the winter. However, another reason I chose a dark gray instead of black is that it's also lighter in color compared to the black and will hopefully not get too hot in the summer.
26011	10	0	0	white :: because the lighter the colors are the least heat energy is going to be absorbed.
26013	10	2	2	white :: White would keep the dog house cooler. White does attract heat like the color black does. When started at 24(DEG)C, t he black lidded jar went up to an average of 53(DEG)C. And the white lid ded jar, which also started at 24(DEG)C, only went up to an average of 42(DEG)C.
26014	10	1	1	white ::  I would use white paint because it would keep the doghouse cooler. The doghouse will be cooler because the white paint will reflect the light and keep the doghouse cooler.
26015	10	0	0	white ::  it will afect the dog house by the temp in si de becaes the wight atracks less height
26016	10	1	1	white :: i chose white so it would be cool in the summ er
26017	10	2	2	white :: the best color to choose would be white becau se on average white had the lowest temperature of all the colors meeaning the inside of the doghouse would be cooler
26018	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray will be that color because you cou ld actually what color you are doing like when you paint that house and m aybe in the hot summer it wont be as hot if you paint the house bla ck.
26019	10	2	2	white ::  according to the experiment in which the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperature, the color white will keep the inside of the dog house cooler because white does not absorb lig ht.
26020	10	1	1	white :: It well allow it to be coler then bieng hot.
26021	10	2	2	white :: It might affect the temperature inside the do ghouse. The data shows that the white lid has the lowest temperature, the refore making it the best color to build the doghouse with.
26022	10	1	1	white ::  the color white would keep the dog house nice and cool inside in a hot summer day.
26023	10	2	2	white :: The white paint should keep the inside temper ature of the doghouse cooler on a hot day, than say black paint for examp le. When comparing the average temperatures of all the lid colors the whi te lid kept the glass jar at a cooler temperature. On average about 6.6(DEG) C cooler, compared with the averages for the other lids. So, therefore white pa int is the better choice, especially if you are looking to keep the insid e of the dog house cool for your dog on a hot day.
26024	10	2	2	white :: In the expirement is stated that light er col ors are cooler than darker colors.White is a very light color and light c olors don't absorb very much jeat so that means that the dog house won't be to hot.
26025	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be best because it would absorb a little heat but not to much. Its average temperature was 45 degrees which was the middle result of the three so in the winter the dog house would still bring in some heat for the dog and in the summer it wo uld keep some of the heat out to keep the dog cool.
26026	10	2	2	white ::  if the dog house was white then when it is ho t the dog house would be cooler.in the experiment it showed that the aver age tempature for the air was 43 celcius and all the other colors made it hotter like the black lid was 53 celcius.
26027	10	2	2	white :: White will affect the dog house by making it cooler. In the trials, the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as.
26028	10	1	1	dark gray ::  dark grey because in the summer it wont be to hot and in the winter it wont be to cold.
26030	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the doghouse by makeing it hotter.
26031	10	1	1	white :: the color i chose, white, would affect the te mperature because white absorbs less light making the doghouse not as hig h in temperature.
26032	10	1	1	white :: The color of the dog house being white wil ca use the doghouse to stay cooler under sunlight. This is beacuse the color white reflects the light away from the doghouse, and the light will not be absorbed and turned into heat energy inside the doghouse.
26033	10	2	2	black ::  The black would be better to use for a paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer for the dog because in the experiment black made the jar the warmest.
26034	10	1	1	black :: If you use the black then the doghouse would stay warm when ever the sun is out beacause the sun would get more light because it is darker.
26035	10	1	1	dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse dark gray because the temperature, according to their data, is 48(DEG)C and it's perfect temperature, not too cold nor hot, and it barely changes temperature.
26036	10	1	1	white :: The best color to choos for a dog house is wh it because it will keep the dog cooler and it will not get dehidrated. Th e dog will stay cooler inside the white doghouse.
26037	10	1	1	white :: Lighter color means cooler house.
26038	10	2	2	black :: the best paint color for the house would be b lack because it would keep the dog warmer than other colors would. the bl ack lid was 53(DEG), and all others were between 42 and 48(DEG)
26039	10	1	1	light gray :: This color would effect the doghouse because it would not be to hot or to cold.
26040	10	1	1	white :: The color black tends to make things hotter a nd so if u used a white lid it would keep the tempature down if it was a sunny day. For the black lid in the experiment the tempature increased( t emp:54) and for the white it decresed(temp:42). This is because the energ y is sucked out from the dark colors. Also dogs have alot of fur so it wo uld be best to have a cooler house.
26041	10	2	2	white :: I would paint the dog house white. The highes t temperature was 53(DEG) for the black lid. Which would cause the dog t o overheat. While the lowest temperature was 42(DEG) for the white lid. Which would help the dog stay cool. So i would paint my dog house white b ecause it is 11(DEG) cooler than painting it black.
26042	10	1	1	white :: the white is better for the dog house because it wont get to hot inside and not to cold.the hotest it would get in the house is 43 and the coldest it would get is 41
26043	10	0	0	dark gray :: i dont think it will efect it because it has the same number for each trial
26044	10	0	0	white ::  I think white is the best coler out of all of the choses here because black is not esey to find in the dark but white is esey to find.
26045	10	0	0	black :: it might blow it up
26046	10	1	1	white :: this color is the best becouse it wont atract so much heat energy and it would be fresh for the dog
26047	10	0	0	white :: it will start like geeting old and it wont look like new anymore it will have like scratches and mud and some black things
26048	10	2	2	white :: it would be much cooler inside the dog house because the color is light and reflects light better. as it said in the r esults, it had the lowest temperaute of 42 degree's Celcius
26049	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray as a good color for the do ghouse because the color does not absorb as much energy as a darker color such as black. The color black which absorbs a lot of energy, results in high temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as li ght gray that still absorbs some energy but not as much and causes lower temperatures. Based on the experiment, the results show that that light g ray absorbs enough energy to keep the average temperature inside the jar at 45(DEG)C, 8(DEG)C less than black which absorbs more heat and causes higher temperatures. Therefore, a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray.
26050	10	2	2	black :: the darker the doghouse color, the greater th e increase in air temperature in the doghouse because the color absorbs m ore energy. In the experiment, the color black absorbed the most energy, causing the inside of the jar to be the warmest. The results for black we re 54 (DEG)C, 52 (DEG)C, 54 (DEG)C, and 53(DEG)C. While all the other colors that were lighter, absorbed less energy.
26051	10	2	2	white ::  i honestly would most likly choose white because all dark colors (dark gray, black,light gray) the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors (white) the sun reflects off of it so w hite would be best because it would keep the dog when its in the dog house white would keep it not so hot but it would still be hot on a hot day but thats my opinion and thats why i would pick white, what would u pick?
26053	10	2	2	white :: it would keep the doghouse cooler because the white lid kept the jar the cooler than the other lids did
26054	10	2	2	black :: The doghouse will be warmer. The doghouse wil l be warmer because in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest .
26055	10	1	1	light gray :: They would want it between black and white so it will be warm and cool. The tests showed that Dark or Light gray is ab out 46.5(DEG)C so it will be good for the dog.
26056	10	1	1	dark gray :: i think dark gray because in the summer it wo nt get to hot but in the winter the color will still gather energy to kee p the dog house fairly warm.
26057	10	2	2	white :: How the white paint will affect the dog house is it wont absorb so much heat, so the dog wont be as hot. If Brandi an d Jerry were to choose black paint it will absorb all the heat because in the experiment in trial one its ((DEG)C) was 54, in trial two its ((DEG) C) were 52, in trial 3 its ((DEG)C) were 54 and the average is 53. So these re sults show that the doghouse will contstanly be warm so this will not mak e the dog comfortable with all the heat. While the white lid in the exper iment had very low temperatures its ((DEG)C) were 42,43,41 and its avera ge came to 42 ((DEG)C) so this shows that the white will absorb barley a ny heat.
26058	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse, because it would attract the heat and keep the inside of the dogh ouse warm. According to the results of Brandi and Jerry's experiment " lid vs. air temperature" the balck lid kept the inside of the jar warmer t han any of the other colored lids. So, therefore the black paint would ke ep the inside of the doghouse warmer than any of the other colors.
26059	10	0	0	dark gray :: because that would be the color to choose
26060	10	1	1	white :: I chose white because white is a nice cool te mperture and dogs have fur so then they would be even a little bit hotter . The reason i know that white would be a pretty good temperture is becau se in the experement the white lid was averaged to be 42 degrees calcus, and so that is apretty good temperature for the dog house.
26061	10	1	1	dark gray :: it might get a little warm in the day time bu t it will keep the inside of the dog house warm in the night.
26062	10	2	2	white :: The color white would be a great color to use in a doghouse because the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog soo when its hot then it wont be to hot in its house. I say this bec ause the average temp of the color white is 42(DEG)C while the other 3 c olors are above this average temp.
26063	10	0	0	light gray :: This could color might affect the doghouse, b ecause the temperature in the doghouse could change depending on the temp erature outside the doghouse.
26064	10	2	2	white ::  The color White might affect the inside of th e doghouse by keeping it the coolest. The average for the color black was 53(DEG)C, the average for Dark Grey was 48(DEG)C, the average for Ligh t Grey was 45(DEG)C, and the average for White was 42(DEG)C. This shows that White is the coolest color and should be used for the doghouse to k eep the doghouse cool.
26065	10	1	1	white :: If the doghouse was white then when it is hot outside the dog will be cold, and when it is cold outisde the dog has fu r to keep him warm.
26066	10	1	1	white ::  The doghouse will stay cool because white ref lects all the colors heat so the house will stay cool.
26067	10	2	2	black ::  the color black heats the doghouse the most. it gets to 53 degrees celcius in there where as dark grey=48 degrees, lig ht grey=45 degrees, and white=42 degrees. so black would be the best colo r
26068	10	1	1	dark gray :: the dark gray will obsorb some heat and keep the dog house warm
26069	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house by heating it up because black absorbes more energy.
26070	10	1	1	white :: White was written down as the coolest in the test and you would want the dog house to be cool when it is hot out.
26071	10	1	1	white :: The internal temperature of the doghouse will be cooler than a doghouse that is colored black. This is only the case i f the external temperatures are hot and the dog needs a cool place.
26072	10	2	2	white ::  White is the best color for a doghouse roof because in the summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool inside for the dog the doghouse is for. After all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day? I chose white to be the best color for a doghouse roof because the average air temprature inside the jar with the white lid was cooler than the air temprature in the light gray, dark gray, or black lidded jars. With a starting temprature of 24(DEG)C for each jar after ten minutes the temprature of the air in jar with the white lid had a average temprature of 42(DEG)C while the jar with the highest average air temprature of 53(DEG) C was the jar with a black lid which means the jar with the white lid had an average air temprature 11(DEG) C cooler than the average of the jar with the black lid. Which is quite a diffrence if you ask me.
26073	10	2	2	black :: The doghouse should be painted black because then the dog will stay warm during the winter if he/she has to stay outsi de. When the black lid was used in the expiriment, it was on averag e 5 degrees warmer inside the jar than with the dark gray lid, 8 degrees warmer than the light gray lid, and 11 degrees warmer than the white. The refore, if the doghouse is painted black, the dog will keep warm much bet ter than if the doghouse was painted dark gray, light gray, or white.
26074	10	2	2	black :: Having a black doghouse will keep the dog warm in the winter because the "Hot Lamp" experiment shows that darker colors obsorbe more heat than lighter colors.
26076	10	2	2	light gray :: brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse L IGHT GREY because the dor wouldnt get to hot because his dog houdse is a dark color and it wouldnt get to cold either with a very light color so t hat is why they sbould paint it light grey because its not to light and i ts not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45(DEG) and for black it was 53(DEG) a nd dark grey 48(DEG) and for white was 42(DEG) light grey is the averag e of them all, 53 ( black) - 48 (dark grey) = 5 53 (black) - 45 ( light grey) = 8 and 53 (black) -42 ( white) = 11 light grey (8) is i n the middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey is the color they should pain t the dog house.
26077	10	1	1	black ::  It will make the dog house warmer inside
26079	10	1	1	light gray :: the color would keep the dog house cooler tha n the darkgrey and black color.also its warmer than the white colored hou se.
26080	10	1	1	black ::  The color black absorbs all the colors of lig ht so the inside of the doghouse would be hot becase the color is absorbi ng and trapping the heat from the light.
26081	10	2	2	light gray ::  dark colors makes things really hot for examp le the black reached up to 54* C white color makes things a little to cold for example it only reached up to 43* C the color gray would have the perfect affect for inside the dog house to make sure the dog wasnt to cold but was to hot because for example the color gray reaced up to 46* C at most making it an equal balance between to hot and to cold.
26083	10	0	0	black :: cuhzz i t will effect it cuhz black is a rlly dark colerr,so yahh....
26084	10	1	1	black :: The color will affect the doghouse by making the temperature rise high that it will be to hot for the he or she dog. Also on Trial 1 after 10 minutes it rised to 54(DEG)c which is to h igh the best color to paint a dog house would be white that was 42(DEG)c after 10 minutes.
26085	10	1	1	white :: it would make it nice and cool for the dog
26086	10	1	1	white ::  The temperature inside the dog house will be cooler than if they use a darker color such as black.
26087	10	2	2	white :: brandi and jerry would want to paint th e dog house light gray. painting the dog house light gray would be the b est paint to color the bog house because in the experiment they had foun d out that, painting the house black absorbs more heat energy, and pain ting it white will not absorb enoff energy, so in the middle will be the best for the dog. so not too much thermal energy, but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best.
26089	10	2	2	white :: the color white won't attract as much light a s the black so the dog won't have to suffer really hot weather on sunny d ays. the white compared to the black is a better choice because black col or attracts more light, for example it averaged a 53(DEG)C while the whi te averaged a 42(DEG)C. That is a ll(DEG)C difference.
26090	10	0	0	black ::  so the dog will stay warm at night.
26091	10	0	0	white :: because it could get dirty or somethen.
26092	10	1	1	black ::  i chose black so the inside of the dog house can be warm at about 53(DEG)C and wont get cold over the time the dog is outside
26093	10	1	1	white :: Well the color "white" makes it so that inside of the doghouse would be more cooler because the sun reflects off white and it wont be as hot inside the doghouse.
26095	10	2	2	black :: I believe that the best color for the dog hou se would be black especially in the winter because it will keep the inside of the dog house warm because the darker the color of the object the greater increase in air temperature inside the object according to th e data table in "Hot Lamp" so the darker the color the warmer t he house or object.
26096	10	2	2	white ::  According to the reults, the lighter the colo r, the colder the temperature is. Since white had less heat, they would w ant to paint the dog house white.
26098	10	2	2	white :: The color white would keep the doghouse the c oolest temperature . On average , the color black is 53(DEG)C , dark gre y is 48(DEG)C, light grey is 45(DEG)C, and white is 42(DEG)C .
26099	10	1	1	black :: this color will keep the inside of the dog ho use warm during winter because dark color absorbs more heat energy.
26101	10	2	2	white :: By painting the doghouse white, the inside of the doghouse will be cool acording to the results of the experiment. The data shows that when the lid was black, the air temperature was warmest, and when the lid was white, the air temperature was coolest. Therefore, painting the doghouse white would create a more comfortable temerpature f or the dog.
26102	10	1	1	light gray :: because light gray is in between hot and cold so the doghouse wont be to hot for him to stay in or too cold for the dog to stay in black being hottest and white being coolest
26103	10	1	1	black :: black will mack it hot in the dog house because the lap is hiting black and black atrackes heat
26104	10	0	0	light gray :: Light gray would be a great color for a dogho use. Although it can still cause an affect. The light gray color can caus e the dog house to not have the right temperature in side. The results wo uld be that if the color was light gray is would be about a good temperat ure inside the dog house. Like in Trial 1 in the jar the temperature was 44, in Trial 2 the temp. was 45, Trial 3 it was 46 as the temperature. The average was 45, so with that said the light gray color is good enough because the average temp. is no t as bad and it wouldnt be so dark inside.
26105	10	2	2	white :: White. It is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the lowest average temperature rise of 18(DEG) C. In the experiment, the starting temperature of was 24(DEG) C and after ten minutes under a lamp, the air inside the jar increased by 18(DEG) C. To tal of 42(DEG) C. If black was chosen to be the doghouse colour, it will not be suitable for the doghouse because the average temperature rise wo uld be too high.
26109	10	1	1	white :: The white paint would keep the inside of the doghouse cool in the sun, because it reflects the most energy, therefore having the lowest internal temperature.
26110	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best paint color for the d oghouse. In the experiment, the temperature in the jar for the white lid averaged 42(DEG) C. The black lid jar averaged a temperature of about 53 (DEG) C. The dark gray lid jar averaged 48(DEG) C, and the light gray l id jar averaged 45(DEG) C. The white lid jar was the coolest out of the four.
26111	10	1	1	black :: It will be warmer inside of the dog house.
26112	10	2	2	dark gray :: The best paint color for the doghouse would b e dark gray. In the experiment of the glass jar it had an average of 48(DEG) C and was the second highest temperature. The highest temperature was the black lid with 53(DEG)C. The difference of the highest temperature and second highest temperature was the 5(DEG)C. If using the dark gray paint color it would still absorb energy to keep the dogs warm, but yet be a bit coo l for them too.
26113	10	2	2	white :: White, because it will keep the doghouse at a cool temperature (about 42 (DEG) C) in the summer when the dog is outside and needs a rest.
26114	10	1	1	black :: this color would affect the dog house because the black would absorb energy from the sun and make the inside of the do g house hotter then the rest of the colors
26115	10	1	1	light gray ::  With a light gray dog house the temperature i nside the house would be cool in the summer, but warm enough for th e dog in the winter. with this balance in temperature you dont have to wo rry about the dog being uncomfortable during any season.
26116	10	1	1	dark gray ::  It didnt get any hotter or cooler, therefore it is the best paint color for the dog house because the dog would not be too cold, nor too hot.
26117	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray is more as cooler than black or dark gray in the summer but black and dark gray will be warmer in the winter light gray or white. Meaning light gray is in the middle.
26118	10	1	1	white :: In the hot summer months the dog house won't get too hot.
26119	10	1	1	black :: the darker the coler is the more hotter it is going to be in the inside and as in black what i picked it is going to w arm for the dog to sleep at night.
26120	10	0	0	light gray :: because it stays at a liveable temp. of 45 de grees.
26122	10	2	2	dark gray :: the dark gray will keep the inside of the dog house warm enough in the winter and not to hot during the summer. the dar k gray was an average of 48(DEG)C which is not as hot as the black lid w hich was an average of 53(DEG)C and not as cold as the light gray which was and average of 45(DEG)C.
26124	10	1	1	white :: the white color will attract less energy than the others, thus making the doghouse cooler
26125	10	0	0	white ::  The color would affect the paint house becaus e. if it is a black colored house. it will be super dark. if it was a whi te color house it would be more lighter. during night time
26126	10	1	1	light gray :: Because you dont want the dog house to be to cool or to warm.
26128	10	0	0	black :: the color might affect the dog house by attra cting the heat to it
26129	10	1	1	light gray :: I would choose light gray because then the dog won't be too hot or too cold.This is why I would choose light gray to paint the dog house.
26130	10	1	1	white :: this color will surely make the doghouse much cooler. I am not sure whether the question is asking which one will keep the dogg cool or hot, so i am choosing white. This color will keep the d og cool when it is hot and sunny. However, this color will not keep the dog warm in the winte r, so i am not sure.
26131	10	0	0	white :: The color that might affect the doghouse is t he white beacuse it was the one that got less then the other three colors
26132	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best choice, because you don't want the dog house to cold, but you dont want it to warm. And the average temperature for the light gray was 45(DEG)C which is just right for a dog, because you don't want your dog to get to hot. And the black wouldn't be a good color, because darker colors absorb more energy. And there was an eight degree difference between the black lid and the light grey lid, making the light grey lid, the cooler, better choice.
26133	10	2	2	white :: White is a good choice because it will absorb less heat. The experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat, so it will keep the doghouse cooler.
26134	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse wh ite. This is because white doesn't attract as much heat. I know this beca use in the previous experiment the average temperature for the white lid was lowest at 42 degrees celsius. Using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot.
26135	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray will make the dog house a bit warme r. The data states that it is 48(DEG) C always.
26136	10	1	1	white :: White reflects more sun, keeping the dog cool er in the summer heat.
26137	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray won't absorb too much sun in which case heating the interior, and it will absorb enough heat on cold days t o warm inside.
26138	10	2	2	dark gray :: I choose light gray because it had an average temperature of 45 which is right in the middle of temperatures and the e ffect will be warm and cool at the same time. When you look at the table of the results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an av erage of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not get too ho t and it will not get too cold.
26139	10	2	2	white :: I think white would be the best color to pain t the dog house. I say this because white absorbs less energy maki ng the dog house cooler. In the experiment, the white on average was 42(DEG) C, and that was the coolest temperature. The warmest temperature of the air in side the jar was the black with 53(DEG) C. For a dog inside a doghouse, i think it shouldn't be hot for the dog, that's why I chose the color tha t made the doghouse the coolest.
26140	10	1	1	black :: the black wood paint would effect the tempera ture more becaasue the darker a color the more energy in attracts. so the black one would be hotter than the white one.
26141	10	0	0	light gray :: if the color are ligth gray than the dog hous e the doghouse will be cooler becuz of tha gray and it also be warm cuz i t light...
26142	10	2	2	white :: the dog house will not be to hot. the tempera ture will rise but it will not rise alot it will stay in cool for summer and they wouldnt have to worry about the dog house getting to hot. white is the one that stayed the coolest and the heat didnt rise alot it stayed about the same temperature the whole time.
26143	10	2	2	black ::  In my oppinion, Brandi and Jerry would want t o paint the doghouse dark gray because it had an average temperature of 48(DEG)C which is the second hottest temperature out of the four lid colors. I think dark gray would be the logical color to paint a dog house because during harsh weather it will keep the dog warm, but during the summer it won't be to uncomfortably hot like black may be.
26144	10	1	1	black ::  This color would help keep the inside of the doghouse warm because the data has proved this. This would help during wi nter.
26145	10	1	1	white :: usually a dog house is only used in the summe r so to keep the dog a little less cooler they should use a white paint. bc i learned that all the colors bounce off white and go somewhere else a long with their heat. but blck has all the colors so it obsorbs all color s and their heat. so white would be best in the table it shows that the average temput ure for a white house is 42(DEG)c. the average temputure for lightgray i s 45(DEG)c, the average temp. for dark gray is 48(DEG)c, and black's av erage temp. is 53(DEG)c. thats an 11(DEG)c difference. whitch could be very important.
26146	10	1	1	white :: The color would affect the doghouse because the lighter the color is the cooler the house would get. if the dog house was black then the doghouse would be too hot.
26147	10	1	1	white :: The color will heat up the doghouse to about 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This is the best color to choose, because the bl ack heated up to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. Therefore, the temperature of t he white jar was 9(DEG)C lower than the black jar, making the white cool er.
26148	10	1	1	light gray :: The doghouse should be light gray because tha t way the air temperature isn't to hot or to cold, it's just about in the middle.
26150	10	2	2	white ::  Choosing the lightest shade (white) is the be st colour to paint a dog house because in order to create an environment most comfortable for the dog year round, the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. Painting the hosue white will ensure that it st ays as cool as it can over summer, thus making it the most comfortable fo r the dog. The white house will remain coolest because as according to th e data collected, the average temperature will be aprox. 42(DEG) C, whil e for the other colours they reached much greater temperatures (45(DEG) LGray, 48(DEG) DGray, 53(DEG) Black). The white colour was 11(DEG) coo ler than the darkest colour (black), thus making it the best colour to pa int a dog house.
26151	10	0	0	dark gray ::  keep it cooler
26152	10	2	2	light gray :: A light gray color could give you less heat i n the summer but during the winter when the the sun is out you could get some warmth. Since in the experiment the black lid would get the most hea t you woulnt want a dog to get to hot, but also not to cold.
26153	10	0	0	black :: cAUSE HE MIGHT NOT WAMT TO SLEEP IN THE DOGHO USE CAUSE OF THE COLOR OF IT AND IT MIGHT ALSO MESS THE DOGS EYES UP TO T HAT COULD ALSO BE IT IN THIS EXPERIMENT
26154	10	1	1	black :: It would make it really hot inside the doghou se because the color black attracks more heat, As aposed to colors that a re very bright like white or light gray or light green even.
26155	10	1	1	black ::  painting the doghouse black might affect it b y attracting all the heat to it and might cause the dog to have a heat st roke while is laying inside.
26156	10	0	0	black :: balck becuase balck goes with every thing
26157	10	2	2	white ::  this is the best paint color for the dog hous e because in the experament it proved that the white matiral absorbed the least amount of heat therefore making the temp. in the jar the lea st
26159	10	1	1	black :: the dog house should be painted black because black absorbes heat. learned thin when the data table showed that the av erage tempature for black was 53(DEG)C. When the dogs out at night you w ould most likely want it to stay warm.
26160	10	1	1	white :: because in the summer, the dog house wount ge t over heated because the average for the white lid in the hot lamp exper iment was 42(DEG)C and the black was 53(DEG)C.
26161	10	2	2	light gray ::  The color chosen will affect the inside of th e doghouse because the color is a factor for the amount of air temperature it attracts. From the experiment, black attracted the most heat (or air temperature) with an average of 53(DEG)C, and dark gray had an average of 48(DEG)C, light gray had 45(DEG)C, and the color white with 42(DEG)C on average. Based on these results, i think light gray is the best paint color for a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of heat, fewer than darker colors, but from the average air temperature in the glass jar from the experiment, the air inside the doghouse would be more withstandable than that of black paint or dark gray which would attract even more heat. Therefore, light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse.
26162	10	0	0	black ::  Has the most average.
26163	10	2	2	black :: i think they should use a black for the dogho use because since we live in a generaly cold area and the black paint wou ld help keep the dog warm at night with the average temp of the air when the area is black is 53(DEG)c
26164	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would keep the dog house a bit war mer without making it too hot like the black and dark gray would.
26165	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark grey is best because in the winter the d oghouse will absorbe heat. Also in the summer the doghouse will not absor be too much heat. like if it was black.
26166	10	1	1	light gray :: It makes the doghouse a little cool but not t oo hot because on hot days it should be cool for the dog to go in there a nd rest. On colder days the dog should be able to go in there and still b e a little warm.
26167	10	0	0	black :: it wold atracket heat or inorge frume t he sun
26168	10	0	0	dark gray :: It will become light in there because if you have dark gray it will infect the color from the outside
26169	10	1	1	light gray :: the house wouldnt get to hot for the dog and it wouldnt be too cold it would be in the middle
26170	10	0	0	white :: .
26171	10	2	2	black ::  I think black would be the best color for the doghouse. It will atract more heat inside the doghouse than any other color because in the experiment with the jars, the black lid jar had the warmest inside temperature. This black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out. When it is warm outside and the dog gets hot, it can sleep outside.
26172	10	1	1	dark gray ::  it had a steady temperature, and for outside, it wouldnt be too hot or too cold if the roof was painted dark gray.
26173	10	2	2	white :: If the doghouse was white, the inside of that doghouse would keep the temperature inside cool because, like in the experiment, the color white only got an average of 42(DEG)C. Unlike the col or black, which got an average temperature of 53(DEG)C.
26175	10	0	0	dark gray ::
26176	10	1	1	light gray :: it will be warm for a dog that is meant to be outside and cool during summer
26177	10	2	2	white :: I have chose the color white because it had t he least highest temperature. In the data from the previous experiment th e white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG) making it the least ho ttest.
26178	10	2	2	white ::  White would make dog house cooler i know this because when the lid color was white the average was 42(DEG)C compared to the average for black wich the average is 53(DEG)C.
26179	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color, because it wou ld keep the house warmer. In the experiment, black produced the highest t emperature inside the jar (53(DEG)C)
26180	10	2	2	light gray ::  It would absorb a little amount of heat for t he summer time when it's hot. But because it's also kind of dark it would keep some heat in for the winter. I know this because the black lid abso rbed the most heat and the white lid absorbed the least heat.
26182	10	2	2	black :: black would kepp the dog house the warmest be cause of the averages of all the others were black 53 dark gray 48 light grey 45 and white 42
26183	10	1	1	black ::  The dog house would be to hot since darker co lors absorb more energy.
26184	10	0	0	black :: that color would affect the doghouse because it would be too dark in the inside and dogs dont have eye color so it wo uld be hard for the dog to see. it also takes way longer to dry then the other colors the other colors dryed in the 40's but the black color dryed in the 50 i would not recomend them to color it black
26185	10	1	1	light gray :: In the summer it will not abosrb much heat ke eping the dog cool yet in the winter it will still contain a decent amoun t of heat keeping the dog at least fairly warm.
26186	10	1	1	black ::  The color would affect the dog house because the darkness will help the dog go to sleep better durning the day. Also i t will affect it because the darker the color the greater the incre ase in air temperature in the doghouse.It will also affect it because the darker colors absorb more energy.
26187	10	2	2	black :: Black is the best color for the doghouse in o rder to keep the dgohouse warm. brandi and Jerry's data showed that the d arker the lid (or in this case, doghouse) the darker the color, the more increase in air temperature. Which in the lid experiment, the data showed that black on average had the highest data of 53(DEG)C while others lik e dark gray and light gray had averages of 48(DEG) and 45(DEG) C.
26188	10	2	2	dark gray :: the dark gray will affect the temperature of the doghouse just enough that the animal that's living in it wont freeze or overheat, because the dark gray color in the experiment didn't collect as much heat in the experiment as the black so it wont overheat the the animal and it collect more heat than white or light gray so the opposite effect wont take place.
26189	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would keep the temperature in the summer down so the dog wont over heat. Black Dark gray would be to hot in the summer the dog would over heat, White would be to cold in the winter and summer the dog would freeze. That is why Light gray would be perfect for the dog house color.
26190	10	2	2	white :: i would choose white because it would make th e inside of the doghouse cooler than a dark color so the dog wouldn't hav e to be super hot in the sun. the average temperature for white was 42(DEG) after ten minutes and it was 53(DEG) for black showing that black makes it ho tter inside.
26191	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it cooler than it would with black paint, but warmer than it would with white. In warmer tempatures, the paint will not asborb as much sunlight, so therefore the inside of the doghouse will not be as hot. The black paint had an average tempature of 53(DEG) C, while the light gray had an average tempature of 45(DEG)C. That is a difference of 8(DEG)C. The light gray will keep the doghouse cooler, but it will also keep it a little bit warmer than white paint. The white paint had a n average tempature of 42(DEG)C. The light gray paint would keep t he doghouse 3(DEG)C warmer then the white paint, but 8(DEG)C cooler tha n the black paint.
26192	10	0	0	white :: white will bring more light in the dog house because it is a light color and it attracts light and it will bring more in
26193	10	2	2	black :: black because it well make the dog hous e warmer and the results to the black colr is saying it warmer.
26194	10	1	1	light gray :: the doghouse would be cooler in the summer an d not as cold in the winter the light gray lid was cooler than the black lid which would make it better for useing in a hot environment. the most comfortable color varies with the kind of environment and i am assu ming this is a rather warm environment.
26195	10	2	2	white ::  The best answer would be white because white is a light color that won't absorb heat and dehydrate the dog during the summer. When Brandi and Jerry performed their experiment they found that when a jar had a black lid on it, the temperature inside the jar was an a verage of 53(DEG)C. Whereas, when there was a white lid on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42(DEG) C. That is an 11(DEG) differance. There for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white.
26197	10	1	1	white :: It might not give it much light from the sun or any heat because darker colors attract more energy and light. Just lik e with the jars and the lamp. The jar with a black lid had the highest av erage, therefore proving that darker colors attract more energy.
26198	10	1	1	white :: painting the doghouse white will reflect the sunlight making it cooler in there
26199	10	2	2	black :: Well, darker colors absob more heat than ligh ter energy, so if you paint the doghouse black than the inside of the dog house will be warmer than the inside of a white painted doghouse. When Br andi and Jerry used a black lid (dark color) for the experiment the resul ts were in the low 50's range, 52-54 (DEG)C. but when they used the whit e lid (light color) the results were in the low 40's range, 41-43 (DEG)C .
26200	10	1	1	light gray ::  in the summer the dog house will not be hot
26201	10	0	0	dark gray :: The dark gray wil affect the dog house becaus e no matter what color the doghoue is, the room will still be dark.
26202	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the dog house will be warm during winter so t hat the dog will warm and cofortable
26205	10	2	2	black ::  If Brandi and Jerry were to paint a dog house the color they should choose is black, because its the darkest color so it absorbs the most thermal heat. My theory is correct because in Bradi a nd Jerry's hypothesis "the darker the lid color, the greater the inc rease is air temperature in the glass jar, because darker color absorbs m ore energy".
26206	10	0	0	white :: Using the color white to paint the dog house would make the dog house be the lowest increase in air temperature then t he other colors. The dog house started at 24 degrees for each trial. The dog house would be about 42 degrees and I know that because the first trial was 42 degrees, the second trial was 43 degrees and the third trial was 41 degress. The average temperature is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color to use.
26207	10	1	1	white :: it would make the doghouse cooler inside
26208	10	1	1	white :: If you paint the doghouse white, it will be c ooler inside than if you painted it black. Since black absorbs more energ y it will get hotter faster than if it was painted white.
26209	10	2	2	white :: They should use white because in the other ex priment white was the coolist, so if they use white it will not get to ho t in the dog house.
26210	10	2	2	light gray :: The color of the dog house should be light gr ay because it doesn't absorb as much energy as black and dark gray which had the temperatures of 53(DEG)c and 48(DEG)c in the experiment, so the dog won't feel very hot either and since dogs are always jumping around, they probably already are hot enough. Also if it does get cold, light gr ay will still absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm becuase it's temp erature was 48(DEG)c which is only 2(DEG)c less than dark gray, so i th ink light gray will be the best color for the dog house.
26211	10	0	0	black :: Because the lighter one top put on the doghouse is the white not the black because it a difference of nine.
26212	10	2	2	light gray :: The color white might affect the doghouse, be cause the air temperature on the inside would be a lot cooler, but not to o cold and at the same time not too hot. When the lid color of the glass jar was black, the average air temperatuire was 53(DEG)C, after only 10 minutes, when the starting temperature was 24(DEG)C, which I believe mig ht be too hot for a dog living in a black doghouse. When their was a whit e lid, the average temperature after the same amount of time, and startin g at the same temperature of 24(DEG)C, was 42(DEG)C, which I believe wo uld be too cold for a dog living in a white doghouse. I believe the light gray lid air temperature was niether too hot, nor too cold, because afte r 10 minutes and a starting temperature of also 24(DEG)C, it's average a ir temperature inside was 45(DEG)C.
26213	10	1	1	white ::  white is the best color for the doghouse beca use lighter colors absorb less energy, which is shown on the data chart. it has an average tempature of 41(DEG)C versus the black lid which has a n average tempature of 53(DEG)C.
26214	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark grey would be good because it wont get t o hot or to cold for the dog because the average temp for dark grey was 4 8(DEG)c
26215	10	1	1	light gray :: it will cool and heat up the dog house
26216	10	1	1	white ::  it will make it less hotter for the dog
26217	10	1	1	black :: if it was color black it would make the dog h ouse hot.
26218	10	2	2	white :: White would make it cooler inside for the dog , Because it would reflect more heat instead of taking it in. Also, it wa s cooler inside because white's average was the lowest (42(DEG)) .
26221	10	1	1	white :: White paint will make the doghouse less hot, because it attracts less energy from the sun.
26223	10	0	0	white ::  the doghouse will be warm when the sun hits i t but it won't be so hot and it will be closer to room temperature for th e dog.
26224	10	2	2	black ::  when the jar had a black lid the average temperature after 10 minute was 53(DEG), when the lid was white the average ttemperature was 42(DEG) because the black lid made the jar warmer the doghouse's roof should be painted black to keep the inside of the dog house and the dog warmer.
26225	10	1	1	black :: Now the doghouse can be warm in the winter, b ecause 'dark colors absorb more light', and then the dog can just play ar ound in the yard in summer because everyone usually enjoys sun, even dogs .
26226	10	2	2	black ::  By painting the doghouse black, the air insid e the doghouse will be warmer than if the doghouse was another color. In the experiment, the air from the jar with the black colored lid was 53(DEG) , which is 2(DEG) higher than the dark grey lid, 8(DEG) higher than the light grey lid, and 11(DEG) higher than the white lids air temperature. This shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it.
26227	10	2	2	white :: it wpuld make it less hot by having white bec ause white is a light color and does not coduct that much heat as have bi n shown by brandi and jerry the results were that white had the lowest av erage at 42(DEG) c
26229	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark gray may attract more heat to the dog ho use but no as much as black.
26230	10	2	2	dark gray :: The best color for the doghouse is dark gray because it won't be so dark that it will overheat the inside of the dogho use and it will also retain it's temperature longer through out the night . The dark grey average temperature after 10 minutes was 48(DEG). That i s better than the 53(DEG) average for the black and the 45(DEG) a verage for light gray because it will not be way too warm but it will ret ain it's heat.
26231	10	1	1	black :: The color black would effect the inside of th e doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat, keeping the dog warm. As in the experiment, while the black lid was over the thermometer and th e light was 5 centimeters away, the temperature on the thermometer increa sed by 29(DEG) C.
26232	10	1	1	dark gray :: doghouse will not to hot or cold in summer an d winter
26233	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would work best because then insid e the dog house it would still be warmer than outside, but when it was ho t outside it would not be too much hotter inside opposed to if the dog ho use was painted black.
26234	10	2	2	black ::  With the color black as the dog house the ins ide temperature will be much hotter than the temperatures of the other co lors because the average temperature for black on the experiment wa s 53(DEG)C, for dark gray ave. temp. was 48(DEG)C, for light gray it wa s 45(DEG)C ave. temp., and for the white lid the ave. temp. was 42(DEG) C. controlled varible: temp. in jar before starting exp. responding:air temp. inside jar after 10 min. uder lamp manipulated: lid color
26235	10	1	1	black :: the black color absorbs more energy so when i ts cold outside the inside can heat up by the sun
26236	10	1	1	black ::  if the dog house is black it will increase th e tempeture of the air inside the dog house, making it warmer inside it.
26237	10	1	1	light gray :: it will keep it not to hot and not to cold be couse of the coler that its not to dark adn not to light so it will keep it ice andf cool not to hot or not to cold
26238	10	2	2	white ::  the reason they should pick white is because it will cool down the tempature in the dog house the reason I know that i s in the data they did for the experiment it tells you that white is cool er than the rest of the colors
26240	10	2	2	white :: This color will keep the dog house rather coo l that way the dog will not over heat itself. In the experiment, lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature.
26241	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray color might affect the inside of the doghouse because if it isnt to dark or to light the inside wont be to hot or to cold. This is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy. The light gray was about in the middle with 45(DEG)c so i thought it was the best choice for the dog.
26242	10	2	2	white :: White will be the best color for the doghouse because the white lid kept the jar coolest, meaning that white paint wil l keep the doghouse coolest because it reflects more energy than any of t he other colors. the white lid kept the jar an average of three deg rees celcius cooler than any other color.
26243	10	1	1	white :: If Brandi and Jerry dont want the dog to get to hot then they would want to pick white because it does not increase th e air temperature as much as black
26244	10	2	2	black :: I think black would beb best to use for the d oghouse because on winter nights when it gets cold out, the black color o f the doghouse will keep it warmer. Since darker colors absorb more energ y than lighter colors. Black was 53(DEG)C after 10 minutes, while white was 42(DEG)C that is a change of 11(DEG)C warmer then the other.
26245	10	1	1	dark gray :: This color will keep the doghouse warm since it will probably be outside and it won't be to hot either.
26246	10	2	2	dark gray :: The dark grey would keep the doghouse warm, b ut not too hot. This is shown in the experiment when dark grey was the se cond warmest color.
26247	10	0	0	dark gray :: the color of the dog house will cang the air pressure in side
26248	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I believe that dark gray would be the best pa int color for the dog house. Although the temperature inside the do house would be warmer, it would not be super warm and make the dog overheat. A lso, the air wouldn't be too cold that the dog would freeze at night when he sleeps in it. Considering that dark gray had an average of 48(DEG) inside, it appears perfect compared to the white with an average of 42(DEG) and the black with an average of 53(DEG).
26249	10	0	0	dark gray :: Dark gray would be best to build a doghouse b ecause it the temperture stays the same every single time, which means if its cold the temperture stays the same. If its hot, the temperture stays the same and doesnt get to hot.
26250	10	2	2	white :: White would cause the inside of the doghouse to not be so hot on the inside so the dog can stay cooler because with th e white lid, the inside of the jar was the coldest out of all the other j ars.
26251	10	1	1	dark gray :: The tempeture inside the dog house will be wa rm.
26252	10	2	2	white ::  They should use the white color because white doesn't heat up as fast. After 10 minutes, white's tempature was 42(DEG) while black's was 53(DEG). That is an 11(DEG) difference. So the dogho use will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white.
26253	10	2	2	white :: The color white is best for the doghouse beca use the experiment was on the effect of different lid colors on the air t empurature inside a class jar so looking at the chart the color white h ad an average of 42(DEG)C which means that the increase of air was coole r . So the color white will affect the doghouse by the increase of air fl ow and be cooler then any other color.
26254	10	2	2	white ::  The white dog house would not attract as much heat as the darker colors, so if they want to keep their dog at a cool t emperature, then they should go with the white color. The average tempera ture for the black colored jar is 53(DEG) C. The average temperature for the white colored jar is 42(DEG) C. The black lided jar is 11(DEG) C h igher than the white lided jar.
26255	10	0	0	black :: it will usually always be 53(DEG) C in the dog house because that is the average tempature.
26256	10	1	1	light gray ::  The temperature of the doghouse with a light gray paint coating on it would make the doghouse warm but not cold or hot of a temperature of around 45(DEG)Celsius.
26257	10	0	0	light gray ::  the dog will might sleep on the doghouse.
26258	10	2	2	white :: The white attracted the least heat than any o f the other colors. The white Low data for white was 41(DEG) and the hig h data was 43(DEG).
26259	10	2	2	white :: the white would keep the dog house nice and c ool in the experiment white attracted the least heat. example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black.
26260	10	2	2	white ::  painting a dog house white will keep it coole r than other colors. in the experiment white had an average temp of 42(DEG) C while black had a 53(DEG)C average
26261	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best color to paint the do g house. In the experiment white didnt absorb that much heat, stayi ng at a temperature of around 42(DEG). This would mean that the dog hous e would stay a cool temperature for the dog.
26262	10	2	2	white :: The white paint will be the coolest paint cho ice for the doghouse. In the data Brandi and Jerry collected, white had t he lowest temperature average of 42(DEG)C. The next coolest was light gr ey with an average of 45(DEG)C, dark grey with an average of 48(DEG)C a nd the hottest was black with an average of 53(DEG)C. Therefore white pa int will make the doghouse the coolest.
26263	10	1	1	black :: Since black absorbs more light than the dark gray, light gray, and white, it will make the doghouse warmer. This will help because in the winter when he needs the doghouse the most, it will k eep him warm when he is inside of it.
26264	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best paint color for the d og house because on a hot day the dog wont get as hot. This is because f rom the results it was that white paint got as high as 43 and black got a s hot as 54
26265	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would affect the doghouse by keepi ng it slightly warmer in the winter, and cool in the summer.
26266	10	2	2	white ::  It would keep the doghouse cooler, especiall y in summer months when there are high temperatures outside (ex: in the experiment the average temperature of white was 42(DEG), the coolest temperature of them all) . This would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating.
26267	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house is white, then it will be co oler. Since the white lid made the inside of the jar 42(DEG)c, and the b lack lid made the inside of the jar 53(DEG)c then we know that white wil l make the doghouse cooler.
26268	10	1	1	black :: by making the doghouse black it would absorve heat energy that will make the doghouse warmer than if it was a lighter color.
26269	10	2	2	white :: White would affecvt the doghouse by making it cooler and not so hot. This is because in the experiment the black absor bed the heat so it would be hotter so making it white according to the da ta will make the doghouse cooler
26270	10	0	0	white :: White would make it more comfortable for the dog and it would be warmer than black because the black absorbs more ener gy than light colors.
26271	10	1	1	white :: If the doghouse was painted white, then the a ir temperature inside wouldn't change very much. It would be cooler.
26272	10	2	2	black :: The inside of the doghouse would most likely be the hottest beacuse the black absorbs the sunlight, therefore it would become hot on the inside. Results from the experiment are that the black lid had a high of 54 degrees celcius and that is higher than the rest of the colors.
26273	10	1	1	dark gray :: According to the results that they got this c olor remained constant throught all 4 trials. This means that if they use this to color the doghouse the dog wont get to hot or too cold but it wi ll remain a average temperature of 48(DEG)
26274	10	0	0	white :: decrease the tepmpature
26275	10	2	2	white ::  hite will keep the doghouse cooler inside bec uase white attracks less energy than black, dark grey, and light grey. th e white was the lowest average tempatue a 42(DEG)C
26277	10	0	0	light gray ::  the dog might not be able to see it in the ni ght.
26279	10	2	2	white ::  The black paint made the air in the jar 53 degrees while the white paint was only 42 degrees. The white paint woud be best for the doghouse because it would keep the doghouse cooler if it was hot outside.
26280	10	1	1	black :: This color might affect the doghouse, because when the sun shines the sun in black then the temperature will ri se from the dog house and making the doghouse hot.
26281	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the doghouse the coolest beca use the other colors got tempatures of 53(DEG)C, 48(DEG)C, and 45(DEG) C, but the white jar got 42(DEG)C.
26283	10	2	2	dark gray ::  The doghouse wouldn't be too cold or too hot, it would be right in the middle. Black, which is 53 C (average) would be a little too hot and white, which is 42C would be too cold, so the one i m the middle which is dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house.
26284	10	0	0	white ::  the white might let sunlight come in the dog house
26285	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house because when is sunny and bright the color will attract the heat and it will make it e ven hotter in the out side and the inside of the dog house
26286	10	1	1	white :: white is best for the dog house because if it was black the dog house would get hot
26287	10	0	0	black ::  Black will affect the doghouse because dark c olors absorb more energy.
26288	10	2	2	white ::  By choosing the color white, Brandi and Jerry 's doghouse would be colder than if they chose any of the other color opt ions. In the experiment, the average temperature for black lid was 53(DEG) c, for dark gray 48(DEG)c, for light gray 45(DEG)c, and finally for white 42(DEG) c. Which means that the white doghouse would be colder than any of the other color options.
26289	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose the color light gray.Light gray would make the dog house around 45(DEG) C average on the inside. The results show that light gray was an average of 45(DEG) C and black was an averag e of 53(DEG)C. White was an average of 42(DEG) C. Light gray is 3 degre es warmer then white and 8 degrees cooler then black. Light gray is a col or in between the temperatures, leaving the dog house not to hot or not t o cold.
26290	10	1	1	light gray :: Would make it warm in winter and not boiling hot in summer.
26291	10	2	2	black :: The other colors had between 40(DEG) and 50(DEG) but black is hotter then the other colors.
26292	10	0	0	light gray ::  Black could turn the inside of the dog house to hot for a dog to be in it so i choose light gray because the heat it a ttracts will make the inside nice and warmin ten minuets it would only be 45(DEG) compared to the black were in ten minetus it would be53(DEG) w hich would clearly be to hot for a dog.
26293	10	2	2	white :: White, because white reflects the sun and the doghouse wont get hot like it would if you use black. In your data it sh ows that in the trials white will be the least hot color.
26294	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because the darker the colo r, the more heat it attracts. For example, during the winter, the dog ins ide the doghouse might get cold, so the sun shinning on the doghouse will absorb the heat and let the heat inside. But sometimes the dog might not want so much heat, so i picked dark gray instead of black. Also, another example is in the summer time, if the dog doesnt want to go outside, and stays in the doghouse, he doesnt have to be so hot. But he can also go o utside if the doghouse is to warm.
26295	10	1	1	black ::  black because then in the winter when its get s cold whatever sunlight there is it will obsoub the heat and make it sli ghtly warmer
26296	10	2	2	white :: using white paint would keep the temperature inside of the doghouse low on a sunny day. the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the average temperature of the blace lid was 53(DEG)C, the white lid was 11(DEG)C cooler then the jar with the blac k lid
26297	10	1	1	light gray ::  it will keep it warm for those cold night an d keep it cool for those hot summer days.
26298	10	2	2	black :: Using a black paint color for the doghouse wi ll make the doghouse nice and warm for a dog during the cold seasons when a doghouse is needed the most. Due to the data, a black lid color had an average of 53(DEG)C. That will affect the doghouse by making the doghou se much more warmer in temperature. A white lid only had an average of 42 (DEG)C, making it too cold for the dog. That's why a black doghouse is b est for a doghouse to keep the dog warm.
26299	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best paint color because it doesnt attract as much heat as black, light gray, or dark gray because its the lightest color. This is good because in the summer, if the dog house attracted a lot of heat, the dog could over heat and get sick. The black lid got the hottest air temperature, having an average of 53(DEG)C, dark gray was the second hottest, having an average air temperature of 48(DEG)C, light gray had the second coolest air temperature, on average being 45(DEG)C, and white had the lowest air temperature with an average of 42(DEG)C. These results show that the white lid attracted the least amount of heat, and is therefore why I believe that a white dog house would be best.
26300	10	0	0	dark gray :: The Dog house will be warm but it will probab ly always stay around the same temperature because in the trial Dark Gray was always 48 degrees celcius
26301	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would not affect that much in the inside of the house because when it's warm the dog would not be too hot a nd when it's too cold the dog would still be able to be warm. As you can see in the data collected if they choose black color to paint the doghous e &amp; it was hot the dog which could harm the dog, and if it they painted it white around winter the dog would be freezing, so I believe t hat light gray would be perfect because it doesnt affect the inside of th e doghouse as much as the other colors.
26302	10	1	1	white ::  i would say black because it exsord bes heat to make it worm inside. And th ey said the dark the color the greater the air temputure in the glass jar
26303	10	2	2	white :: If you paint it white the doghouse will be co oler in the hot summer sun. In the experiment the average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG) but it was 53(DEG) for the black lid. You pr obably don't want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white.
26304	10	0	0	dark gray :: It will keep the doghouse's interior at an av erage temperature
26305	10	2	2	white :: White would affect the inside of the doghouse becuase it is a light color so it will absorb less enrgy becuase the dar ker the color the more enrgy it will absorb. In teh data table from their experiment, black absorbed the most energy and white absorbed the least energy so that is why they should choose white for the doghouse
26306	10	0	0	black :: the best paint color for the dog house would be black because the darker the doghouse the grater chance it will have o ut in the sun
26307	10	2	2	white :: The best color would be white because white had an average temperature of 42(DEG)c compared to the other temperatures. White would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible.
26308	10	0	0	black :: Black Will Efect The Dog House Alot In The Su mmer Because Balck Is An Energy Color.
26309	10	1	1	white ::  This color will affect the doghouse by making it colder. If they live in a hot place this would be the best color to c hoose from.
26310	10	2	2	white :: i think that brandi and jerry should paint th e doghouse white. i believe that white would be the best color because in the results it shows that white collects less heat and energy. that wpul d be good because if it was sunny and the dog wanted to go somewhere cool he would have his white dog house that doesnt suck in all of the heat.
26312	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray will keep the doghouse cooler that black because lighter colors reflect more light than darker colors. Dark colors do not reflect light well, instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures. In winter light gray will keep the doghouse slighty warmer than white would and it will keep the doghouse cooler in the summer.
26313	10	0	0	light gray :: it will heat the doghouse up just enough to b e the perfect temperature.
26314	10	1	1	light gray ::  On hot sunny days the color of the house wouldn't absorb so much heat, So the house woldnt get so hot, But if it was a cold day the colors of the house could reflect the cold air, Becuas e, Lighter colors reflect heat, &amp; darker colors absorb heat.
26315	10	0	0	light gray :: because the dog might be jumpy and get mud paw prints on the house
26316	10	2	2	black :: The paint color will help to keep the dog war m becuse in the results of the experiment the black lid heated up faster.
26317	10	1	1	white ::  The Best color would be white because as show n in the table white absorbs less heat energy and therefore stays cooler so that means the dog would stay cooler.
26318	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler. I know this because the temperature for the air in the glass jar with the black lid was warmer then the white lid.
26319	10	2	2	black :: In the experiment the black lid on the jar he ld the most heat so if you colored the doghouse black the temperature ins ide the doghouse would stay at a higher constant temperature. The black l id had the highest average temperature of 53(DEG)C, dark gray had an ave rage temperature of 48(DEG)C, light gray had an average of 45(DEG)C and white had the lowest temperature with 42(DEG)C
26320	10	2	2	white :: White would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer. the average temperature of the white-lid-jar was 42(DEG), while the averge temperature of the black-lid-jar was 53(DEG). the white was 11(DEG) cooler, so if the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from being fried in the summer.
26321	10	2	2	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry painted the doghouse dark gray, I think it would be just warm enough in the winter and just cool e nough in the summer, because dark gray has the medium-warm temperature on the chart about the colored lids.
26322	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose dark gray cause it will be warm for the dogs in the winter, and cool in the summer.
26323	10	2	2	white ::  in the experament the color white absorbed less heat. so if you want your dog to stay cool you should pick white that way he or she isnt as hot.
26324	10	0	0	dark gray :: easy to light make stay drak
26325	10	2	2	white :: The purpose of a dog house is to have a place where a dog could get out of the sun or rain. White is a good choice bec ause it let the least amount of heat into the jar. The tempature of the w hite jar was an average of 11(DEG) C less than the tempature of bla ck jar.
26326	10	1	1	white ::  it will be cooler inside
26327	10	2	2	white ::  This color will cool down the dog house. The results show that on every trial the whites temperature was lower than al l other colors in the expirement.
26328	10	1	1	light gray ::  I think light gray paint would work best to paint the dog house because in the summer black would be way to hot for the dog. The dog would feel most comfertable in a light colerd house in t he summer so that it is a comfertable tempuature. But in the winnter white would be to cold and the dog would freeze. The dog would want to be warm in the winter. In the expirament the black heated to 53(DEG)C an d the white heated to 42(DEG)C witch is a difference of 11(DEG)C. That is why the dog house should be light gray insted of black, white or dark gray.
26329	10	2	2	white ::  Painting the doghouse white would keep the temperature cooler inside the dog house. The jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar. The darker the color of the lid got, the warmer the inside of the jar was.
26330	10	0	0	white ::  i think white because had the less average in side the glass. the reason i didnt pick the other colors is because it is gonna be to dark so therfore you couldnt see anything t night so t heir i would pick white because u can see them better
26331	10	1	1	black :: black might affect the doghouse because its going to be dark,hot, and not cmfortable.
26332	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because the white paint color d oesn't abosorb that much energy than the other colors and also the air te mperature inside wouldn't be as high as the other colors. So if the white doghouse was placed under the sun and the starting temperature would be 24(DEG)C the average temperature would only rise up to 42(DEG)C. But if the color of the doghouse was black or gray than the temperature would b e in the 45(DEG)C - 53(DEG)C. So white doghouse would be a great pick f or the color of the doghouse.
26333	10	1	1	light gray :: I picked Light gray because in the winter he can be warm and in the summer cool. This, color means that we wouldnt be hot on the summer and cold in the winter.
26334	10	2	2	black :: Black will make the doghouse to hot. The dog will not go in the doghouse because the dog will not feel comfortable. I n the lab, the black got way more heat then the others colors that were u sed.
26335	10	0	0	white :: white doesnt take in colors from the rainbow like black and other colors
26336	10	2	2	black :: Black absorbs heat therefore it would make th e dog house warmer than all of the other colors. This can be supported be cause in the expirement black got up to 53(DEG)C and the white only got up to 42(DEG)C. Black was the warmest
26337	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray would be best because it wouldnt b e not to hot and not to cold.
26338	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark gray because it wouldn't be to hot and it wouldn't be to cold.
26339	10	1	1	black :: black will keep the dog warm but if you live in a hot area than white
26340	10	2	2	light gray :: the dog house color should be light gray beca use in the lid experiment the hottest color was black and the coolest col or was white .i chose light gray because you dont want the dog to be to c old in the dog house because in thelid experiment the coldest lid w as the white lid and the average temperature for that lid was 42(DEG)!so i though is stead of having the dog house that cold why not have it ligh t gray because the average temperature for the light gray lid turned out to be 45(DEG)
26341	10	2	2	white ::  it should be white because in the experiment, the white lid had the lowest air tempeture. you dont want your dog tog e t to hot during the summer.
26342	10	2	2	white ::  the color white would be good for the doghous e becuase it is the color that does not atract heat so the inside of the doghouse wont be hot. in the experiment the color white was the lowest te mpeture out of the other colors so it would be the best color for the dog house.
26343	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because the white was the coole st in all 4 trials. The white coloring repelled the heat of the lamp keep ing it cool. On hot days the dog would stay cool.
26345	10	0	0	light gray :: If you paint the inside of the doghouse light gray it would affect the temp. of the inside of the doghouse.It would ke ep it warm inside if it was cold outside.
26346	10	1	1	black ::  It might affect the doghouse because it obesv ers heat energy with a darker color.
26347	10	1	1	white ::  White paint would make the dog house cooler b ecause white paint reflects light.
26348	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray because that way the dogho use could stay cool and the dog wouldn't be too hot. Black was an average of 53, and Light gray was 45. So its a just right roof.
26349	10	1	1	black :: black absorbs more heat from the sun this is good beacuse in the winter the dog will be very warm insidebut durning th e hot summer ddays the dog probly wont use it so black would be the best option
26351	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for the dog hou se because in the experiment the data in the chart shows that white kept the coolest temperature of 41(DEG)C, light gray had the second coolest t emperaturee of 44(DEG)C, dark gray had the second hottest temperature of 48(DEG)C, and black had the hottest temperature of 54(DEG)C.
26352	10	0	0	white ::  the color white would be a good color for a d og house because from the data it says that the average temperature was 4 2(DEG) in side the jar thats only went up 18(DEG)
26353	10	1	1	light gray :: the color light gray will heat the dog house but it wont over heat it and it will not under heat it either.
26354	10	1	1	black :: Blacvk will affect the doghouse becuase It wi ll make it warmer for the dog to like in.
26355	10	1	1	light gray :: I would chose light gray because on a cold da y, any heat you be absorbed into the doghouse and the dog wouldnt be that cold but on a hotter day, the gray wouldnt let in so much heat the the dog would be to hot.
26356	10	2	2	black :: it will make the dog house warmer than any of the other colors because in the experiment the black lid had the warmest effect on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the dog house
26357	10	1	1	black ::  dark grey keeps a consistant heat level so it will not get super hot or cold in hot and cold seasons. this will keep a dog more comfortable.
26358	10	2	2	dark gray ::  -they should use the dark gray beause they want the dog house warm for the winter and the nights but not to warm because of summer, if they use the dark gray then the dog house stays warm for the winter and not too hot for the summer. - this color will affect the inside because it is a darker color but it is not too dark the dark gray willkeep the dog house warm and cozy for the dog but not to warm for the summer. -the dark gray kept the jar at a tempature of 48(DEG), the black kept it at 53(DEG), the light gray kept it at 45(DEG), and the white kept it at 42(DEG). thease results show that if they used black the dog hose would get to hot. if they used the white the dog house would be too cold. the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog.
26359	10	1	1	white :: The color white would effect the dog house by making it cooler inside.
26360	10	2	2	light gray ::  That color would effect the dog house because when the sun was up it would maintain 44(DEG)-46(DEG)c. That would keep the dog comfortable while the sun was out.
26361	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse bec ause since white is a very light color it does not absorb light as well a dark color would.The dark color would not only absorb the light but woul d also create heat energy.From the results in the experiment white was th e color that I had chhosen because the air in the glass jar did not get n ear as hot as all the others.Also picking the color that didnt create as much heat as all the others is the best to choose because then the dog st ays cool.
26362	10	1	1	white ::  It would not affect the doghouse to much beca use it absorbs less heat then the other colors and that allows the doghou se to not get to hot.
26363	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark gray will make the dog house absorb alot of energy but not as much as black because in the experiment it averaged at 48(DEG)c and black averaged at 53(DEG)c.
26364	10	1	1	white ::  white has less energy absorbed so it will coo l down better than black would.
26366	10	2	2	white :: this color will affect the doghouse by making it cooler on the inside because in the air temperature data, Brandi and Jerry figured out that white colors didnt attract much heat because compa red to the black to white lid, the black lid was 11(DEG)C more hot than the white lid.
26367	10	2	2	white ::  White would be a good color for the doghouse because it doesnt absorb as much energy as the other colors. This means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot. In the scenario, the temperature of the air for the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the temperatures of the Black,Dark gray and Light gray lids were 53(DEG)C, 48(DEG) C and 45(DEG)C. This information shows that the white lid had a lower temperat ure than the other three lids.
26368	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house was white the inside would b e cooler then the rest of the colors. In the experiment the white lid was 11 degrees cooler then the black.
26369	10	1	1	white :: i would paint it white, that way, showing fro m the table, the tempurature wouldnt get so hot.
26370	10	2	2	light gray ::  The color light gray would be the best paint for the doghouse. During the experiment, light grey had an average of 48(DEG)c, compared to black whos average was 53(DEG)c and white whos was 42(DEG)c. Light grey would affect the doghouse becasue it is a color that soaks up heat but not so much that it would overheat the doghouse.
26372	10	2	2	white ::  The dog house will remain cooler in the summe r. The white lid only had an average of 42(DEG)C in the jar, while the black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C in the jar.
26374	10	1	1	white :: Because the lighter the doghouse is the coole r it is in the sun.
26375	10	2	2	white ::  If Brandi and Jerry chose white as the color for their doghouse, then it'll affect the temperature by it being much cooler inside, rather than a black or dark gray color which would make it much warmer.
26376	10	1	1	white ::  White will attract a less amount of heat to t he doghouse. It is the best paint color because it will provide shelter f or the dog from the sun and provide a cooler environment.
26377	10	1	1	white ::  if they used white for the color of the dog hous it would keep the inside of it cool because white reflects ligh t.
26379	10	1	1	light gray ::  I would chose light gray because from all the colors it isn't the least amount of air temperature and it isn't the gre atest. So, I believe that its just right for the dog because it won't suf ficate or it wont have to much. The first trial for the light greyt was 4 4(DEG)C and the temperature just went up by one which makes it 45(DEG)C and the third trial it also went up by one 46(DEG)C. This makes the hou se very predictable about what the temperature is going to be.
26380	10	2	2	white :: A white doghouse would make the inside of tha t doghouse cooler in the summer, but it wouldnt make it as warm in the wi nter, since in the expirament the white lid captured less light than any other color of lid.
26381	10	1	1	dark gray :: This color will make the temperature in the d og house will cause the dog house to stay cool but also collect heat. In the experiment the dark gray got up to 48(DEG)c .
26382	10	2	2	black :: Black will make the doghouse warmer than the other colors because it got an average of 53 while the other colors got i n the 40's.
26383	10	2	2	black :: Black might affect the doghouse because this color will heat the dog house the most. Black, based on the experim ent, was able to absorb the most light energy out of all the colored lids . For example, in trial 1, black had a termperature of 52 degrees c elcius compared to dark gray which was 48 degrees celcius. Light gr ay had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius. Evident ly, black will keep the doghouse most warm compared to the other three co lors.
26384	10	1	1	white :: White becase the doghouse wont get to hot for the dog and the temurature will be at a low risk for the dog to get heat stroke.
26385	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray is a good choice because it keeps the doghouse cool on a hot day but it will keep some heat on cooler days.
26386	10	1	1	black ::  This color will make the doghouse absorb more light. Because it is black, heat will absorb on this faster then dark gr ay, light gray, or white.
26387	10	2	2	white ::  If they use white the doghouse will be cooler than if they used black because the average temperature inside the jar w as 42(DEG)C for a white lid and 53(DEG)C for a black lid.
26388	10	1	1	light gray ::  I chose light grey because it will still attr act heat and absorb some but not a ton. This way the dog house will be at the right tempature and out of the sun. Choosing a light color for this will be good for spring summer fall or those winter days when the sun comes out. It will be a dry place at the perfect tempature if you paint it light grey.
26389	10	1	1	white :: The white dog house can help the dog cool off and it keeps it cooller in the Dog house unlike Black and the darker colors that abosorb, The heat and then so warm the dogHouse and There by inc reasing the Tem(DEG)
26390	10	1	1	white ::  white because that color doesnt absorbs enery and the doghouse be cooler
26391	10	1	1	white ::  it will make it cooler in there, so its not b urning hot in the summer
26392	10	1	1	black :: if its black the doghouse might cunduct more heat but if you choose a lighter color it will not atract as much heat as the dark color.
26393	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun. White would be best because it will absorb the least energy, keeping the temp down, in the test a black colored lid was and average temp of 53, while the white color was 42, and 11(DEG) difference.
26394	10	2	2	light gray :: light gray would make it so the dog was cool inside the house and not to hot and to cold. at black the temperatu re was 53(DEG)c and at white the temperature was 42(DEG)c. but at light gray it was 45(DEG)c so then the temperature would not be to hot or to cold.
26395	10	1	1	white :: Brandi and Jerry should use the color white f or the dog house because brighter colors reflect light to keep the dor co ol. Unless, it is the winter time and you want to keep the dog warm a dar ker color would be better.
26396	10	2	2	white :: I chose white for the color of paint for the dog house. White might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day. When the glass jar had a black lid the average temperature was 53(DEG)C. When the glass jar had a white lid after ten minutes the average temperature in the jar was only 42(DEG)C. This is a difference o f 11(DEG)C. White is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse bec ause it will keep a dog cool in the middle of the day.
26398	10	0	0	light gray :: This color should make the doghouse a nice co ol temperature cosistantly. I say this because in the data table light gr ay's average temp. was 45(DEG).
26399	10	2	2	black :: I think this color will effect the dog house by heating it up when there light energy or heat energy inside of it, bec ause black got the highest average of 53 C(DEG)
26400	10	0	0	white ::  its not to dark
26401	10	2	2	white ::  white would affect the color by not letting the dog house heat up because with the data the result was, the darker the color the more heat so the color white would keep the dog house nice and fresh.
26402	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I chose the color Dark Gray Because when it i s cold outside the house will absorb heat and warm up the doghouse so it wont be cold. But when it is really hot outside it wont absorb as much energy as the black paint so it will be a little cool.
26403	10	2	2	white :: white made the jar the coolest on average in the experement at 42(DEG)C. while black, on average, made the jar the ho ttest at 53(DEG)C. so if you painted the dog house white the temperature inside the dog house should be cooler than if you painted it black, dark gray, or light gray.
26404	10	2	2	white :: If your design for your doghouse was to keep the dog out of the heat then you should choose the white because after ten minutes of a lamps heat the white color kept the temperature down to 42 (DEG)C while the black lid kept the temperature to 53(DEG)C
26405	10	1	1	white :: If the color of the doghouse was white then i think the dog that lives there will want to go in the doghouse more ofte n because its not going to be really hot, its going to be cool.
26406	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray. Because the color is not that dar k, but not that light ether. For the summer it wont be that hot, and in t he winter it wont be that cold ether. Also the tempetures of the data cam e out that the gray color is right in the middle(average) of the experime nt.
26408	10	0	0	dark gray :: The greater the increase in the air temperatu re in the glass jar , because darker colors absorb more energy.
26409	10	2	2	black ::  It would make it warmer for the dog so it wou ld be warmer inside the doghouse so the dog would not be too cold. In the experiment the results show that the darker the color, the warmer it is inside.
26411	10	1	1	black :: i think that black she psint the doghouse bec ause it dark and it could absorb more energy and increase in air tempertu re.
26412	10	1	1	white ::  the test proves white dosent get as hot as ot her colors
26413	10	2	2	white ::  the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white because white dosent absorb as much heat as d oes darker colors, for example, in the air temprature expeirament. they p ut a dark colord lid over a jar, with a starting temprature poitn at 24 c elcius. after ten miniutes the took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and was recorded at an averege of 53 c. but when they p ut the lighter coverd lid over the jar (at a starting point of 24c) after 10 miniutes they saw that the jar was an averege of only 42 c. so the be st choice would be the color white for your dog house because it will not absorb as much heat and will stay cooler for your dog.
26414	10	2	2	dark gray :: The dark gray color for a doghouse might be b est to keep the dog warm in the winter with the little sun it receives, b ut not overly heated in the summer. In the experiment, the dark gray had the second to highest air temperature with 48(DEG). A black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog. In the investi gation, the air temperature of black was at 53(DEG). The light gray and white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthy for the dog. The air temperatures of the light g ray was 45(DEG) and of the white was 42(DEG). This is why I would choos e the dark gray paint for a doghouse.
26415	10	1	1	white ::  As shown in Brandi and Jerry's experiment, wh ite absorbs less light than the other colors. If the doghouse is painted white, than the air temperature will be less inside of the doghouse, so t he dog will be cooler inside of the doghouse.
26416	10	2	2	white :: In the testing of which color made the air in side of the jar hottest, the black was the hottest, then came the dark gr ay, than light grey, then the white was the coolest so the air inside of the doghouse would be cooler if it was white which would be best for the dog.
26417	10	1	1	white :: it will make it cooler inside because the whi te coloer will deflect light from the house
26418	10	0	0	white ::  dark colors atract heat lighter colors reapel heat
26419	10	0	0	black :: be geos once you go black u never go back
26420	10	1	1	white :: they should choose white because they dont wa nt their dog to get really hot and white wont absorb that much heat so it will stay cool on the inside.
26421	10	1	1	light gray :: light grey would work good because its almost in the middle and maintains a good temperature so it doesnt get to hot b ut not to cold
26422	10	2	2	white :: White is the best color to use for the doghou se. This is becasue the color white reflects the most sunlight and theref ore it wont be as hot insdie the house. With the white colored jar lid, t he average tempurature is 42 (DEG) C. The averages for the Light Gray, D ark Gray and black lids were 45 (DEG) C, 48(DEG) C and 53(DEG) C. This shows that having the doghouse be white would keep the air cooler and mo re comfortable for the dog.
26424	10	1	1	light gray ::  it will make it cool on warm and sunny days b ut on winter days it wont be too cold and it will act as both warm and co ld depending on the day
26425	10	0	0	white :: In the summer the doghouse would not be to wa rm and not as hot as warm as a doghouse that is black.
26427	10	0	0	black :: i think black would be the best color because when it was in the glass bottle after 10 minutes it had the highest scor es.
26428	10	1	1	dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse da rk gray, because then inside of the dog house it would not be too hot or too cold for their dog. If they painted the house black, it would be too hot. The average temperature was 53(DEG)c and the dark gray average temp erature was 48(DEG)c. Light gray and white would make the inside of the doghouse too cold, because those temperatures averaged at 45(DEG)c and 4 2(DEG)c. Therefore, dark grey is just right.
26429	10	1	1	white ::  i chose white because the dog could go in the dog house and not get to hot from the heat of the sun because white does not catch heat as easaly as black.
26430	10	2	2	white ::  In the experiment they said darker colors aso rb more heat, and you do not want more heat in you're dogs house. And you dont want you're dog to overheat so I picked white so it stays cool duri ng the summer.
26431	10	1	1	white :: I say that they should use white because from the data they had from the experiment,it shows that darker colors absorb s more energy then any other colors. White would not take as much absrob energy as shown in the data table given because it's a light color and it would be better for the dog not to have as much absorb energy in it's ho use.
26432	10	1	1	light gray :: If you were to paint the dog house light gray the tempature inside the dog house would not be as hot in summer time or not as cold in the winter time as if you were to pick white it would be colder and black it would be hotter and dark gray would be hotter just n ot as much. light gray would be just in the middle of all of them.
26434	10	1	1	white :: is because on a hot day it wont be as hot in the doghouse if you use white if you use b-lack the dog would be to hot.
26435	10	1	1	black :: It will be the hottest because darker colors absorb more energy.
26436	10	1	1	dark gray :: This color would make the doghouse warm but n ot too warm and it wont be cold inside either.
26438	10	1	1	white :: the inside of the doghouse would be cooler wi th the color white and with black it would be hotter
26439	10	0	0	black ::  Black because it effect lid color on the air temperature and because it absob more energy.
26440	10	1	1	white ::  Having a white color for the dog house will effectively keep the dog at a temperature where the sun wouldn't gradually increase the temperature too hot for the dog to live inside dog house. According to a experiment on Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar, a white lid did not help increase the temperature inside the jar. While a grey and black lids effectively increased the temperture over 6 degrees.
26441	10	0	0	dark gray :: I choose dark gray as the color for the dogho use because the white color would be good for summer, but then during the winter the dog would get too cold. The black color would be good for win ter, but then during summer the dog would get too hot. The light gray col or would be good for summer, spring and winter, but not for fall. The dar k gray would be good for summer, fall and winter, and the dog would proba bly spend most of his/her time outside during spring. I would paint the d oghouse dark gray.
26442	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best color for a dog houise beacuse if the dog is outside and its cold outside, the light gray still atractas some warmth to it but not too much for when its hot outsi de. In the experiment light gray had the averge of 45(DEG)C while white had 42(DEG)C and the black had an avergae of 53(DEG)C. This shows that white would be too cold becuase it would not attract alot of sunlight. T he black is too hot by attracting too much sunlight but the light gray at tracts enough sunlight to keep the house cool and warm.
26443	10	1	1	light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse by makin g the doghouse not too hot and not too cold for the dog; a comfortable te mperature for the dog.
26444	10	0	0	black :: Trial 1: (54), Trial 2: (52), Trial 3: (54), Trial 4: (53). This color would keep keep it warm when It needs to be war m, and keep it cool when it needs to be cool.
26445	10	0	0	white ::  That color might affect the doghouse, because the tempurtue will be good for the doghouse.
26446	10	1	1	light gray ::  i choose light gray because in the winter gra y is kinda dark it will be warm, and in the summer it will be cool cause of the light gray.
26447	10	1	1	black ::  The color black absorbs more light, so the do ghouse will be warmer.
26448	10	1	1	dark gray :: the darker the color is the hotter the inside of the house will get so i picked dark grey because black might make it too hot when the sun is on it and white would be too cold.
26449	10	1	1	black :: Black would affect the air temperature in the dog house. In the experiment the black lid color had on average of 53(DEG) C. This color would greatly effect the dog house in the summer. On hot days, the black color would attract heat, which would be a health issue for the dog.
26450	10	0	0	light gray :: Light gray would be a good color because if y ou used black then that would attract energy from the sun causing the sun to hitthe dog house and the dog will get to hot. So if we use light it w ill slightly attract some energy from the sun because the color is a mixt ure between black and white making the dog the right temerature.
26451	10	1	1	light gray :: it will help yhe dog house becuase in the sum mer it wont be to hot and then in the winter it will kepp it warm a littl e
26452	10	2	2	black :: This color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors. Dark gray's average temperature was 48 d egrees celcius, light gray's average temperature was 45 degrees celcius, and white's average temperature was 42 degrees celcius.
26454	10	0	0	white :: It might affect it by the (DEG)c level in th e dog house and it will make it not as cold as the other colors so it a h otter tempature.
26455	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the dark gray could help the dog stay cool in the summer but also stay warm in the winter. in the results of the lab, the dark gray had 48 degrees all the way through the experiment. The dark gray color would be the best color for the dog house.
26457	10	1	1	dark gray ::  It makes the house pretty hot so the dog won't get cold but it's not so hot that the dog will get too warm
26458	10	0	0	light gray :: Becasue it isn't too dark and it isn't too light , it's just right for the dogs eyesight .
26460	10	2	2	black :: if they use the color black the inside air te mpature would be the warmest according to there data.
26461	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think that a dark gray would be the best co lor to paint the dog house. Sense dark colors attract solar heat...but it all depends on where the dog house will be located...for example...if yo ur somewhere where its normally hot outside...you should paint the house white or light gray. But if this dog house is going to be somewhere where its normally cold outside...paint it dark gray or black.
26462	10	0	0	black :: its my favorite color
26463	10	1	1	light gray :: I think it wuold be light gray because dogs d ont like to be that warn and not that cold.
26464	10	2	2	white :: If you paint the dog house white, it will sta y nice and cool and won't get too hot because the data showed that when t he lid was white, the average temperature, 42(DEG)C, was colder than the others. When the lid was black the average temperature was highest, 53(DEG) C, which is 11(DEG) more than the white lid's average.
26465	10	0	0	white :: ti make ti litere
26466	10	1	1	white :: i think they should paint the dog house white because in the summer it will keep the doghouse cooler insi de and keep the dog from getting to hot.
26467	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray might not affect the dog house bec ause in the summer when its really hot it went wont get really hot inside because light gray is not as dark. The dog house might just be the right temperture not to hot and not to cold just right.
26468	10	1	1	white ::  It will affect the doghouse because i won't be as hot inside if its painted white but if its painted black or another color it will be hotter inside.
26469	10	1	1	white :: White would affect the doghouse by making it cooler than any other color shown.
26470	10	1	1	white :: white will make the dog house as cool as poss ible
26471	10	2	2	white :: Having a white colored dog house is the best option because its the one that got the lowest temperature in the experim ent which was 42(DEG)C average. And since you dont want your dog to get a heat stroke then whites the best. The other colors averages were black= 53(DEG)C dark gray=48(DEG)C and Light gray= 45(DEG)C which are to hot for a dog to be living in.
26472	10	0	0	white :: This is the best possible paint color for a d oghouse for the summer. But for the winter it would be black.
26473	10	2	2	white :: whtie is the best color to paint the dog hous e because, in Brandi and Jerry's experiment the darker lid's had a higher tempature. black had a ending tempature average of 53(DEG) C and the wh ite lid had a ending tempature average of 42(DEG) C. therefor, white wou ld be the better paint color to keep the dog house cooler for the dog.
26474	10	1	1	white ::  The white paint would make it colder in the doghouse on hot summer days.
26476	10	0	0	black :: Because it's average is very high. And it cou ld do something to it.
26477	10	1	1	black :: Darker colors attract and absorb more light s o if you paint the doghouse black then the sun's rays will hit the house and cause the black paint to absorb the light and keep the dog house warmer.
26478	10	1	1	light gray :: it will heat the dog house so it is warm and not to hot or too cold because in the data the light gray color was just about the middle.
26479	10	2	2	white :: the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse allot cooler compare d to the black lid at 53 degrees celcius
26481	10	2	2	black ::  if they used black for there dog house there dog would be very warm because it would keep all the heat in there for keeping the dog warm because the black will be traping in the heat that is why people don't wear black on a hot day. I can say this because in the data table for black the average temperature was 53(DEG) and that was the highest temperature there was this is why I think Brandi and Jerry should use black for there dog house.
26482	10	2	2	white :: It would make it cooler than the other colors . White ended up about 42(DEG)C while black was about 53(DEG)C.
26483	10	0	0	white ::  White will affect the doghouse because its average of air temperature inside a glass jar for 10 minutes was 42(DEG), while light gray was 45(DEG), dark gray was 48(DEG), and black was 53(DEG) .
26484	10	0	0	black :: Because dogs are colored blind and if the dog house is painted black then the dog wouldnt be able to see it.
26485	10	2	2	white :: White will reduce the temperature in side the doghouse. In the experiment white had an average of 42(DEG)C while the other colors had higher temperature averages.
26486	10	2	2	black :: The black paint would absorb heat. That would keep the doghouse warm. The results showed that the jar with the black l id was th warmest after 10 minues.
26489	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark gray would be better because you dont wa nt the dog to be cold if it were to live in the dog house but you dont wa nt it to be to warm for the dog.
26490	10	2	2	white :: White is a very light color. But with black i t attracts the sun. so inside this doghouse when black, it can get hot. b ut with the white it can also get warm but not hot as 53(DEG)c as the black had. the white had a average of 42(DEG)c which is not hot comp ared to 53(DEG)c.
26491	10	1	1	black :: the color affects the dog house by the tempat ure inside the doghouse if the color is darker it will be hoter if the co lor is lighter it will he colder and so on. and because the doghouse will probaly be outside i chose black so that it is warmer
26492	10	1	1	light gray :: it won't be as hot inside of the doghouse, ma king it more comfortable for the dog in the hotter months, but it will st ill be warm enough that the dog will be comfortable in the colder months.
26493	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color might affect the doghouse because l ight gray will not make it too hot or too cold, the temperature will be in the middle.
26494	10	2	2	black :: this color will help keep the insideof the do ghouse warmer. the black colored lid is 9(DEG) warmer than the white col ored lid.
26495	10	2	2	light gray ::  After being exposed to heat, white was the coolest with 42(DEG)C, followed by light gray with 45(DEG)C, dark gray, and then black. By using light grey, the doghouse would stay fairly cool in the summer, unlike black, and absorb a fair abount of heat in the cold winter, unlike white.
26496	10	2	2	black ::  Well the darker the color is the more heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because the dog is outsid e, so the dog will stay warm at a good temperature. on the table of the expirement it shows that having a black lid on trial one gave it 54 degrees on white on trial one it was only about 42 degrees. 12 degree difference!
26497	10	1	1	white ::  it will not make it hot during the summer so the dog can cool him self
26498	10	2	2	white :: i would choose white because it will keep the dog cool in the summer time because the white lid had an average tempera ture of 42(DEG)C whereas the light grey had an average of 45(DEG) C, the dark grey had an average of 48(DEG)C and the black had an average of 53(DEG)C.
26500	10	2	2	white ::  The color white would affect the doghouse by cooling it off because in the experiment the air temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 degrees in comparison to the air temperature in the jar with the blakc lid which was 53 degrees. That makes black 9 degrees hotter then white.
26501	10	0	0	white ::  Whit wouldnt arelly affect it cause in the wi nter there is not much sun so the color would make no difference but in t he summer it would be the same because sun does not affect the color whit e especailly in the heat.
26502	10	1	1	black ::  becuase when it gets hot outside the sun atracts black and then it will heat up the doghouse and the dog house would get to hot and then the dog would really hot.
26504	10	0	0	light gray ::  i have know idea
26505	10	2	2	white ::  White will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors. This is because, the average air temperature of the jar w ith the white lid was 42(DEG)C, the light grey lid was 45(DEG)C, the da rk grey lid was 48(DEG)C, and the balck lid was 53(DEG)C. The differenc e between the darkest (black) lid and the white lid was 11(DEG)C.
26506	10	2	2	white :: white so the doghouse stays cooler because ac ording to the table white makes the temp inside the jar the coolest
26507	10	1	1	black ::  Black would affest the dog house becasue the sun attracts to black very easily and will make the dog house very hot on the inside.
26508	10	1	1	white :: it will make it cooler for the dog and the do g wont over heat and become thirsty all the time
26509	10	1	1	white ::  The white paint color would keep the inside of the doghouse more cooler than the other colors because lighter colors absorb less heat.
26510	10	1	1	black :: They should do the dog house black because th e aveerage in the expierament was 53(DEG) and that is around the temepat ure that a dog would wanna stay in while its sleeping , also beacuase whe n its sunny the black darkens the dog house while the dog sleeps.
26511	10	1	1	dark gray :: I picked ths color because if it is hot day the dog wouldnt want his house black because it will just make it too hot for him, then if its white it will just be too cool for him. So I that dark gray will be just warm enough for hiom
26512	10	2	2	light gray ::  The best color for Brandi and Jerry to paint their dog house would probably light gray. This is because while the lid that absorbed the most heat (black) had an average temperature of 53(DEG) C and the coolest (white) had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C, the light gr ey lid had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C, a medium between the two, which would make the doghouse retain heat in the winter and keep it cool in the summer.
26513	10	1	1	dark gray ::  can keep warm temperature for the dog in the Winter but not so hot in the summer
26514	10	0	0	white :: IT WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE THE WHITER THE COLO R THE BETTER BEACAUSE IT WILL NOT ABSORB THAT MUCH ENRGY .
26515	10	1	1	white :: This color would affect the doghouse because the color white reflects light, while as the color black or darker colors absorb light, so with the choice of white, the doghouse would not heat u p as much as it would if Brandi and Jerry were to use a darker color.
26516	10	2	2	black :: This color will keep the inside of the doghou se warmer. Dark colors absorb more heat energy. In the experiment w ith the jar, the air was always warmer in the jar with a black lid rather than jars with lighter color
26517	10	0	0	black ::  This color might affect the dog house becaus e black absorbs the most energy that is given. It is shown in the results that black lid color has an average of 53(DEG)C
26518	10	1	1	light gray :: I chose light gray because it would stay cool in summer and a little warmer in the winter.
26519	10	2	2	black :: Using black as the color of the doghouse will make it hotter. In the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest . This would help the dog stay warmer in the winter. It would be the best color choice as long as the owners live in a cold climate.
26520	10	2	2	light gray :: The light colro of the dog house will hlp to keep the doghouse cool and ideal in hot temperatures, but will also absor b enough thermal energy from the sun to had a semi-warm environment. Whil e the black lid color in the experiment created an average jar-air temper ature of 53(DEG), that temperature is very hot and a dag would feel very uncomfortable within that environment. However, if we look at the white lid, it had an average temperature of 42(DEG). That temperature is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough thermal evergy on days that it is cooler. However, the light gray lid had an average of 45(DEG) in the tr ials. Its temperature was msot ideal and it would create the most balance d environmetn for the dog to live in.
26522	10	1	1	white :: the color white would affect the doghouse bec ause the tempuature will be cooler.
26523	10	1	1	light gray :: It would keep the dog house at a good tempera ture not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house isnt very cold.
26525	10	2	2	white :: White because white absorbs less heat energy from the sun.In the experiment Brandi and Jerry discovered that darker co lors affect how much energy they can absorb. So that's why white is the b est color to choose to make a new doghouse.Because it doesn't absorb that much energy from the sun.
26526	10	2	2	black :: Black (darker) colored paint will absorb the energy from the light source (lamp) and keep it heated up inside the dog house. Like the "Air Temperature" experiment, the black lid color, had 54(DEG)C while the white lid color had a 42 (DEG)C, proving that the darker the color there is, the more heat is absorbed, keeping it more warm.
26527	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark grey would be the best color for them to make the dog house because the air temperature wouldn't be too hot or to o cold for the dog. Also the temperature stayed the same for all the tria ls which means that it won't change no matter how hot the weather may be.
26528	10	2	2	dark gray :: I would choose to paint the doghouse dark gra y because the color would not be too dark or too light so it wouldn't mak e the doghouse too warm or cold. The data supports this because the jar w ith the dark gray lid had a temperature that was more in between that of the black and white jars, when the light gray jar had a temperature that was closer to the white jar, making it to cold.
26529	10	2	2	white ::  it would affect the doghouse by it would stay cool in there. In the experamint white had the lowest temputure
26530	10	0	0	dark gray ::  not a lot just a agents the sun
26531	10	1	1	white ::  It will make it warm inside the doghouse beca use the light did not penetrate it alot, so the thermometer did not go as high
26532	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will keep it a nice temperature not too wa rm and not too cold
26533	10	0	0	white :: It wont be as hot for the dog.
26534	10	0	0	white :: i think white because it would keep the most heat out
26535	10	1	1	black :: the color black would effect the doghouse bec ause the sun is attracted to the color black.also in the data table the color black has the highest results on the temperture.
26536	10	2	2	dark gray :: This color will allow the doghouse to be reli tively warm in the winter yet cool enough in the summer to keep the dog c omfterble. The average temperature of the Dark Gray lid was 48(DEG)C, 5(DEG) C cooler than the average temperature for the hottest lid, which was the Black lid, and therefore shows that the doghouse will be able to sustain a comt erble temperature.
26537	10	2	2	white :: the dog house should be white because the col or white, deflects the heat waves so the inside of the dog house would be cooler. If the dog house was painted black, it would absorb more heat wa ves and then the dog house would get hotter.
26538	10	1	1	light gray ::  It will make the dog house warmer in the wint er but will not make it too warm in the summer.
26539	10	1	1	white :: Paint the doghouse white if where you live is hot, because black attracts too much heat. Paint the doghouse black if y ou live somewhere cold because the heat can't affect that.
26541	10	1	1	white :: i picked the white color because the affect o f white color paint makes the temperature for the dog house to be alot mo re cooler so if the dog house is white the dog's temperature will be alot more cooler than the other colors their is
26542	10	0	0	black :: the color might afferct the doghouse because mybe the dog dasent like the color they put on the dogs house or myebe is to dark or to briet for the dog. and calculate and rec ord the average air temperature for each lid color .
26545	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler because the black had an average of 53(DEG) C. The dar k gray had an average temperature of 48(DEG) C, and the light gray had a n average temperature of 45(DEG) C. Finally, the white had an average te mperature of 42(DEG) C. So the black jar had the highest temperature (da rkest color) and the white had the lowest temperature (brightest color). So inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint
26546	10	0	0	black :: The color black might affect the dog house be cause black is the drakest color out of the's four colors.
26547	10	1	1	white :: It should be white beacuse if its a dark color it would attract motre energy/heat.
26548	10	1	1	black ::  the black is going to make it a lot warmer in side the dog house
26549	10	1	1	white :: white because it will not tack or exorb the h eat.
26550	10	1	1	black ::  It might affect the doghouse because its a dark color and it will be darker and hotter in the doghouse sence dark colors absorb more engery.
26551	10	2	2	black :: This color paint (Black) will attract more he at to the inside of the dog house. We know this because the averge of hea t in side the jar on Bradi and Jerry exsperiment was 54(DEG) C for black paint and 42(DEG) C for the white paint. So you can see that if you wer e wanting to keep the inside of the doghouse warm you would want to paint it black.
26552	10	1	1	black :: The color black might affect the inside of th e doghouse because if the color of the house is darker it will increase t he temp of the house inside
26553	10	1	1	black ::  it will make the temperature inside of the do ghouse hotter.
26554	10	2	2	white :: Painting the doghouse white will make it so t hat the temperature inside will be cooler, because as tests show, white c ompared to black can have a temperature difference of 12 degrees celsius.
26555	10	1	1	white ::  The white color may affect the dog house by making it more cooler than solid colors because it reflects the light insted of absorbing more light energy caused form the sun.
26556	10	2	2	white :: white reflect the light. when you use white c olor temperature will lower than when you use dark color. In the expieren ce when you use white the temperature was42(DEG)C but when you use black the temperature was 53(DEG)C. When you use white color temperature was 9(DEG)C lower than when you use dark color.
26558	10	2	2	dark gray ::  During each trial it stayed 48(DEG)C Which i snt to hot or cold. It might affect it buy whether its snowing or really cold outside he wont freeze because the color is trying to attract some k ind of heat. For when its hot It would attract some sunlight though but n ot as much as black. So its fairly compfortable for a dog.
26559	10	1	1	black :: black would be the best color to use so that the dog will stay warm. the average tempature using black was 53.25(DEG) C
26560	10	1	1	black :: Painting The Doghouse Black Will Result In Th e Temperature Inside To Be Higher. The Darker The Color Is On The Outside Will Absorb More Heat Energy Into The Doghouse. This Will Help Because I t Will Keep The Dog Warmer.
26561	10	1	1	black :: It would affect the doghouse because the colo r black is going to make the doghouse hotter.
26562	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might affect the inside of the dog house because the result in the experiment was that the lighter the color the lower temperature. I chose light gray because on sunny days when the dog need shade or cooling off it can just go into the doghouse where it will be the perfect temperature; cold, but not freezing.
26563	10	0	0	black :: the color that i chose that may effect the in side of the dog house because from heat it will give the dog shade for th e dog house. from the expirement it shows when they put th e dark black lid on top of the gar it hows that the temerature decreases after they put the thermometer in the glass gar.
26564	10	0	0	black :: will absord more energy
26565	10	2	2	white :: it would be the best because it would keep th e dog cool because what had the lowest average temperature
26566	10	1	1	white :: the white absorbs less heat and keeps cooler
26567	10	2	2	white ::  white will keep the doghouse cooler, because it will be only 42(DEG)c inside, then if Brandi and Jerry were to use black it would be 54(DEG)c inside of the doghouse because black absobes light, and white reflects the light so the heat doesnt go inside of the doghouse.
26568	10	2	2	light gray :: light gray because it wouldn't be that hot in the summer time and in would not be that cold. becaue in the results the average for light grey was 45(DEG).and that in perfect tempature
26569	10	1	1	light gray :: I chose the light gray because on average it was 45(DEG)C, so it wouldn't be too hot o too cold for the dog.
26570	10	1	1	white ::  The lighter the color is, the more light ener gy it reflects. If most of the light energy is reflected, the less hotter it will be inside the doghouse or whatever you're painting.
26571	10	0	0	white :: The color of the dog house affected the temperature inside.
26574	10	1	1	black :: it would increase the temerature more than an y colors selected.
26575	10	0	0	black :: black
26576	10	2	2	white :: i think they should go with white so the dog house doesnt get to hot because the black paints number was 53 for the av erage and the litest color whites average was 42 so i think that the colo r that would be best for the dog house would be white beacuse it re flects less heat from the other three colors which were black dark gre li ght grey and white.
26577	10	1	1	white :: it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool er
26580	10	0	0	black :: because black is a dark color and it will atr ackt te sun, so then the tempeture is going to change
26581	10	1	1	light gray ::  They don't want it to be too cold, but not to o hot either. A light gray dog house won't be too cold for the dog, but a lso not too hot because it'll just warm the dog house up 11(DEG)C. That isn't too much, so the dog won't suffocate, but it won't freeze to death either.
26583	10	2	2	black ::  The average temperature inside the glass jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C. With a dark gray lid, the average tempera ture was 48(DEG)C. With a light gray lid, the average temperature was 45 (DEG)C. With a white lid, the average temperature was 42(DEG)C. The sta rting temperature was 24(DEG)C, so the average temperature for the black lid raised the starting temperature by 29(DEG)C. The average temperatur e for the black lid also kept the glass jar 11(DEG) warmer than the whit e lid. Therefore to keep the inside of the doghouse warm, and also to kee p the dog warm in cold temperatures, black would be the best color, becau se it had the highest average temperature inside the glass jar.
26584	10	1	1	light gray :: I believe that the Light Gray color would be optimal for the doghouse. It would keep the temperature inside to a pleas ant level, not too hot or cold. The average temperature of the jar with t he Light Gray lid after ten minutes was 45(DEG) C.
26585	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray will affect the doghouse because, based on the data the light gray color was the second coolest at an avera ge of 45(DEG). This will help because during the summer when it is hot, it will keep the doghouse cooler. But, it will also help during the winte r and keep the dog house warmer.
26586	10	1	1	light gray :: This color would be the best for the doghouse because if you were to use black, the dog would get really hot because t he darker the color the more energy it will attract and make it hotter. I f you use white then it doesn't get as much energy so the dog may get col d because the lighter the color the less energy you will attract. light g ray is inbetween so it will attract some energy but not to much.
26587	10	2	2	white :: the color white may affect the doghouse in a better way than the other three colors because according to the dat a table the lid color black, dark gray, light gray, all had higher air te mperatures. the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar. therefore, white would be a better color for the doghouse becau se the air temperature inside of the doghouse would be less than the othe r three colors.
26588	10	1	1	black :: the color will increase the air tempeature in side the dog house.
26589	10	1	1	white :: this would affect the dog house because in th e summer the dog would stay cool and not get hot but in the winter it cou ldnt get colder than if the dog house was black
26590	10	1	1	white ::  the inside would be cooler because dark color s absorb heat and white refects it
26591	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the doghouse more chill than black or dark gray cause of their hot temps..when white has a temp of 42 degrees celcius..keeping the doghouse nice and cold..
26592	10	1	1	white ::  I think the color for the doghouse should be the color white because it doesnt attract heat and if we were to choose the black color inside the doghouse it would be hot .The black color's average is 53 and the white colors average is 42.
26593	10	0	0	black :: becouse the dog house would look filthy
26594	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house and make it h otter, because black atracts the sun
26595	10	0	0	dark gray ::  dark grey because their all 48in all differen t procdures
26597	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it didnt heat up that much , but it did a little so the dogs house wouldnt get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter
26600	10	2	2	black ::  the color black will make a higher temperature in the dog house then dark gray light gray, or white because darker colors absorb more energy. this is supported by the data of the ex periment hot lamp. the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes for the black lid was 53 degrees celsuis, the average temperature for the dark gray lid inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis, the a verage temperature for the light gray lid inside the glass jar after 10 m inutes was 45 degrees celsuis, and the average temperature inside the gla ss jar after 10 minutes for the white lid was 42 degrees celsuis. this da ta shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the do g house.
26602	10	1	1	black :: it will make the dog house really hot.
26603	10	2	2	black ::  By using black for the color of the dog house , the inside of the house will be warmer than the other colors, because d arker colors absorb more heat. According to Brandi and Jerry's chart it i s true, because after 10 minutes the black lit had the warmest air inside the jar.
26605	10	1	1	black ::  It will make the doghouse warmer inside which would be good for the winter time so the dog isnt cold and miserable.
26606	10	1	1	white ::  the color will affect the dog house because i t will make it alot cooler in the dog house when the sun is out and it wi ll look better(:
26607	10	0	0	white ::  they paint the color whit because it at tracts less sun light.
26608	10	1	1	white ::  white paint color because that way the dog wo nt be hot instead it would be cool
26609	10	1	1	black :: it wil heat the dog house up more than the ot her colors.
26610	10	0	0	light gray ::  eeee
26611	10	1	1	black :: If the doghouse is black, it will absorb more energy then the other colors. This is apparent in the test, where the st arting temperature for the glass jar was 24(DEG) C, and the black jar we nt up to 53(DEG) C, while the white jar only went up to 42(DEG) C.
26612	10	1	1	light gray :: It will make it slighty cooler than hot. It w ill affect the dog house as making the dog house warm on cold days and not to hot on hot days.
26613	10	1	1	white ::  That color would allow the doghouse to be coo ler and not so hot and stuffy.
26614	10	1	1	white :: white because it dosnt obsorb as much heat as dark lids.
26615	10	2	2	light gray :: The color of light gray might affect the dog house by keeping it the right temprature (not too cold or too hot) becaus e the darker the color the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the c ooler it gets, according too the data in which i got the information.
26616	10	1	1	white :: the wite color will make the dog house cooler so it wont be hot and stuffy.
26617	10	1	1	black :: If you had a dog house black then all the the rmal enegy will go to it and be warmer for your dog. Inside the dog house would be warm for your dog to live in. As it shows in the data black was with the highest temperture.
26618	10	1	1	white :: if the dog house was painted black and was exposed to the sun for to long it would get to ht.now if it was painted white the house wont get to hot
26619	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark gray because the temperature wont be to hot or to cold it would be just the right temperature for the dog.
26620	10	1	1	light gray ::  The light gray only attracts 45 degrees celci us and that is pretty warm. During the winter the dog won't freeze and du ring the summer it won't sweat a lot.
26621	10	1	1	dark gray :: The color will affect the dog house by keepin g it warm in winter and not so hot in summer.
26622	10	1	1	white :: white because if not you could over heat the dog yu want to keep it cool
26623	10	2	2	white ::  A white paint on the dog house might work the best for summer and according to the data table, the white color's avera ge temperature was the lowest so it will be good for days when it's hot.
26624	10	0	0	white :: white so it doesnt get hot in there when its summer. cause darker colors attract heat
26625	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse because when the weather is warm outside the doghouse will stay cool but also be a bit warm. Also, when the weather is cold outside the doghouse wil l be warm but aslo a bit cool. I know this because when the light g ray lid was used on the jar the temperature inside the jar was average an d stayed cool. However the lid was also a bit warm. The lowes t temperature inside the glass jar with the light gray lid on was 44(DEG)C while the highest was 46(DEG)C which, if this is the sa me with the doghouse will make the doghouse feel like a great temperature .
26626	10	1	1	white ::  it would make it cooler inside because white reflects the sun rays and black absorbs them.
26627	10	1	1	black ::  The darker the color, the warmer it will be i nside of the doghouse becuase darker colors absorb more energy.
26628	10	2	2	light gray :: The best color to paint a doghouse would be l ight gray because according to the selection light gray was cooler than b lack by 8(DEG) and it was 3(DEG) hotter than white which would allow th e dog to be cooler in the summer but still warm in the winter
26629	10	1	1	black :: the inside of the doghouse would be much warm er inside the doghouse then the other colors. the black attracts more hea t.
26630	10	2	2	white :: White paint would be best because it would ke ep the interior of the dog house cool. The white lid had an average of 42 (DEG) C while the black lid got up to 53(DEG) C. Unless you want your d og to be too hot in his or her doghouse, I suggest you paint it white. Al so, white looks much better on houses than black, dark grey, or light gre y.
26631	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the dark gray might effect the iside by the temputer because the starting temputer in the exsperiment was 24 degrees and it ended up being 48 degrees each time
26632	10	2	2	light gray :: Using a light gray paint on a dog house will help keep it warm inside on cold days and cool inside on warm days so the dog is always comfortable. I would pick light gray for the color because it had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C inside the glass jar and that is a nice even temperature for cold and warm days.
26633	10	1	1	black :: They should paint the dog house black because that on avergage had the highest temperature of 53(DEG)C. Which was 5(DEG) C higher than the second warmest roof color of Dark Gray and 11(DEG)C higher t han the coldest roof color, white.
26634	10	1	1	dark gray :: it wont be too hot or too cold.
26635	10	0	0	dark gray :: dark gray
26636	10	2	2	dark gray :: The white paint would reflect all of the ligh t rays, therefore keeping the dog house cooler for the dog to escape the heat. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG) C air temperature in side the jar after 10 minutes, but the white lid had and average of 42(DEG) C air temperature inside the jar, after 10 minutes. This is a difference of 11 (DEG) C. The white dog house would keep a dog cooler than any other colo r of paint.
26637	10	2	2	white ::  The color White will affect the dog house, by in the summer when it is hotter outside the white wont absorbe to much h eat, keeping the dog house cooler. The average temperature for the Whute lip was 42 (the coolest temperater) And the average for black was 53 (the highest) the lower the number the cooler it is. White would be the best choice for the doghouse.
26638	10	1	1	black ::  Black is the best color because it increases the air temperature so the dog won't be cold.
26639	10	2	2	light gray :: Using Light Gray would keep the tempurature a t an even or equal rate. If it was cold, it wouldn't keep it as warm, but not super cold either. If it was hot outside, the dog house would keep s orta cool, but not extremely hot either. The average of Black is a high a t 53 degrees. which is super hot. Then White would be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees.
26640	10	0	0	white :: The white paint will keep the dog house warm in the winter but won't be too hot in the summer. The average temperture of the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This way the dog will be comfortable in the house with the white paint color.
26641	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray might affect the doghouse because it will absorb enery, making the inside warm for the dog. Since the color doesn't absorb all of the energy, the doghouse will still be cool compar ed to having the paint black and keeping all of the energy in. Light gray paint will absorb only a certain amount of energy.
26642	10	1	1	black :: white because it was less heat in 10min. Also the temputers only got to around 40- 45(DEG)
26643	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it would keep the dog hous e warm and still a little bit cool for the dogs temperature. The temperat ure stays to an average of 45(DEG) C.
26645	10	1	1	black ::  in the summer it can make the inside of the d og house hot.
26646	10	0	0	white :: dark colors will seem confusing just keep it white
26647	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should design a doghouse wit h the color white, because the white lid's average air temperature i n the jar was only 42(DEG) C, the lowest temperature of all the lids. Th is would make the doghouse have a lower temperature when exposed to light , to keep the dog cooler. As you can see the average air temperature in the jar for the white lid was only 42(DEG) C as compared to the black lid which had an average of 53(DEG)C. This is an increase in 11(DEG) C a clear in crease of air temperature in the jar from the white to the black lid, and therefore showing that with the white paint the air temperature within t he doghouse when exposed to light will be the lowest compared to all othe r paint colors tested.
26649	10	2	2	white :: By painting the doghouse white, the temperatu re in the doghouse will not be that high. according to the experiment, us ing a white lid will keep the temperature inside the jar low. so by paint ing the doghouse white, the temperature in the doghouse will stay low.
26650	10	1	1	dark gray ::  This color will absorb enough energy to where the air temperture is comfortable and not very cold or very hot.
26651	10	1	1	white ::  The best color for the doghouse will be white because of the results both Brandi and Jerry did white seem to be the color that is way more cooler than any other colors by this I mean in average tempeture for the color white was 42(DEG) C which means that the dog will feel freash being inside the doghouse every day it not to cold but not to warm either.
26652	10	1	1	light gray ::  black holds heat in so it would be to hot and white hardly holds any heat.so light gray can still hold heat while giving the dog that nice cool feeling.
26653	10	2	2	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their dog house light gray because it won't absorb as much heat/energy as the darker colors. In the data is shows that the black lid got the hottest (53(DEG) C) , while the light gray lid only reached 45(DEG) C. It will still collect heat to keep the doghouse warm but not as much as the darker colors.
26654	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray is a good color because it will ke ep the inside of the dog house not soo hott and not soo cold it will keep it warm.When the sun hits the god house it will not make it really hot a s it would if it were black or dark gray.
26655	10	2	2	black :: i chouse black becase black makes it hoter nd that will affect the doghouse by making it hotter....in the expiriment i t showed that black is hotter.
26656	10	0	0	white :: It won't effect it at all becuase white don't asorb to much energy and won't cuase any heat like black will
26657	10	1	1	black :: if they use the darkest color available then it absorbs the heat energy better so that when the dog uses the dog house it will be warm.
26658	10	2	2	white :: The paint color that they should use is white . This is because the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG), while the average temperatures for the other colors were 45, 48, and 53(DEG) . This shows that the white lid was 11(DEG) degrees color on average than the black lid. Therefore, the dog would stay cooler and more comfortable in t he white house, wheras he could become too hot in the black one.
26661	10	1	1	black :: It would make the doghouse warmer.
26662	10	1	1	light gray :: the doghouse would not get too hot
26663	10	0	0	light gray ::  You dont want the dog to hot so make it so it will be cooler inside. It will be about 45(DEG)C
26664	10	1	1	white ::  white will keep the dog cool in the summer. s o the dog house wont be super hot it will be cool enough to be in comfurt ably for the dog.in the winter it will just be a normal temperature.
26665	10	1	1	white :: white because it holds the least amount of he at.
26666	10	0	0	light gray :: Well ,I pick Light gray because I wouldnt wan t too much energy in my dogs house if i had to pick a color . Most dogs g oes in their house soo they can either cool off or to relax .
26668	10	0	0	dark gray :: The light grey color of the dog house would m ake it nuetral inside because it stayed the same throughout each experime nt.
26669	10	1	1	black :: The sun absorbs more energy in the color. Mak ing the inside of the doghouse hot &amp; warm.
26670	10	1	1	dark gray :: i think it should be dark gray becuase when i ts summer the color will absorb heat so he cant say nice and warm and coo l at the same time..
26671	10	2	2	black :: if they painted the doghouse black, then it w ill be hotter inside the doghouse because the darker the color the more heat it will absorb. example: the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar.
26672	10	1	1	white :: The best color to paint a doghouse is white because white keeps the doghouse less warmer
26673	10	1	1	black :: a black doghouse will hold in heat so the dog wont get cold. a white dog house will make it colder than all of the oth er colors.
26674	10	1	1	white :: the darker the color is the hotter it will be inside. the lighter the color is it will not be as no t inside.
26675	10	2	2	white :: The color white will effect the inside of the doghouse because it will keep it cooler in the summer when it hot. For example, when the white lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to abou t 42(DEG)C but when the black lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 53(DEG)C.
26676	10	2	2	white :: white will, attract less heat. i say this bec ause, it had the lowest average of 42(DEG) thats 1(DEG) less than gray, 6(DEG) less that dark grey, and 11(DEG) less than black.
26677	10	1	1	light gray ::  well if the color is to dark then the doghous e would be to hot so use a color the might not make the dohouse to
26678	10	0	0	black :: i think black would be the best for the color of a dog house because darker color aborb more energy and black is the d arkest one
26679	10	0	0	dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should pant their doghouse d ark gray. I think they should paint the doghouse dark g ray because in the experiment Hot Lamp the average of the averages in tha t experiment was 57, and the closest temperature of the averages in that experiment is the dark gray lid.
26680	10	0	0	white :: because in the graph is says the average is 4 2 and thats why i picked white cause different chemical.
26681	10	2	2	white ::  The color white will affect the dog house by changing the temperature and making it much cooler in the dog house . In the experiment it showed that the color white was much colder thanth e othercolors they testedit was an average of 42 when black was 53C
26682	10	1	1	black ::  The color will keep the doghouse temperature warmer. The black color will absorb the heat of the day and keep the dogh ouse warm at night.
26683	10	1	1	white :: White would be the best because then the dog would not get too hot.
26684	10	2	2	black :: The color Black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse. This is modeled in the experiment because when the lid on the jar was black it had an average inside air temperature of 53(DEG) C and when the Lid color was White the air temperature inside was only an avera ge of 42(DEG)C. So this shows that when the color black is used instead of white you will have an average air temperature increase of 11(DEG)C.
26685	10	2	2	black :: In the expirement, the jar with the black lid was on average 53(DEG)C after being exposed to the lamp for ten minuets . The dark grey lid was only 48(DEG)C, 5(DEG)C less than that of the bl ack lid. The jar with a white lid was only 42(DEG)C, 11(DEG)C less than the jar with the black lid. To warm up the dog house by just the sunligh t Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house black to increase the tempe rature within the dog house. Compared to the results with the jars, the b lack paint would absord the sunlight and warm up the dog house more than painting it white as with the jars expirement, the black lid warmed up th e jar 11(DEG)C more than the jar with the white lid.
26686	10	2	2	white :: I would choose white because, white does not absorb a lot of light so there for, when iit is hot outside your dog will not get to hot inside of its doghouse. I choose the color white because in the experiment it shows that the average temperature for the white lid was 42 and for the Black lid it was 53. that is an 11(DEG)c difference between the two colors. So for a dog house I highly considered it being w hite.
26687	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray will make the dogs house not t oo cold and not too hot for the dog. The average tempature would probably be around 40-50(DEG) because the light gray lid on the jar had an avera ge 45(DEG) C but a dog house is a different size from a jar so the tempa ture will vary a little.
26688	10	2	2	white ::  The best color for the dog house is white. This is because acording to Brandies and Jerrys experiment the white dog house gives the least amount of heat into the dog house. For the Black dog house the average temperature would be 53(DEG)C for the Dark Grey dog house the average temperature would be 48(DEG)C for the Light Grey dog house the teperature would be 45(DEG)C and the White dog house would have a temerature 42(DEG)C. Acording to this data the best color for a dog house would be white.
26689	10	1	1	white :: If the dark the color the hotter it gets why not choose white to keep the dog nice and cool in some ways.
26690	10	0	0	white :: White is the best color for the dog house bec ause darker colors absorb more heat when its warm or hot out. But white r eflects all of that heat energy
26691	10	2	2	dark gray :: The reason that I selected dark gray as the o ptimal color for the doghouse is becauseout of all the colors, dark gray seemed to be the middle tempurature. This tempurature will affect the dog house by making it hotter in the winter when the sun shines on it, and c ooler then black in the summer, because it is a lighter shade than black. This will occur from the dark gray paint, because in the experiment, the use of the black lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 53(DEG). The use of a white lid in the experiment made the air tempur ature inside the jar an average of 42(DEG). The use of a light gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 45(DEG), and the u se of a dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48(DEG). T his shows that dark gray is the middle tempurature, and ideal for a dogho use, because its tempurature was 6(DEG) hotter than the coolest tempurat ure, and 5(DEG) cooler then the hottest tempurature, making dark gray me dium in tempurature, and optimal for a dog house.
26692	10	1	1	dark gray :: That color (dark gray) might affect the dog h ouse by absorbing heat cause it is a dark color,but not as dark black,so it won't absorb so munch heat.
26693	10	2	2	white :: The best paint color for the dog house is whi te because the white color for the lid does not get as hot as the other c olor so itt wont be really hot inside the dog house. Acording to the Air Temperature BLACK average was 53 C(DEG) DARK GRAY average 48 C(DEG) LIG HT GRAY average 45 C(DEG) And the WHITE average 42 C(DEG)
26694	10	1	1	white :: i picked white because it will make the dog h ouse colder even when the sun hits it
26695	10	2	2	white ::  I would choose to paint the dog house white. The reason that I would paint the dog house white is because the inside o f the dog house would then be cooler, rather than if you were painting it black. The average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42(DEG)C rather then when using black after 10 minutes it was 53(DEG)C . This has an overwhelming difference of 11(DEG)C after JUST 10 minutes
26696	10	2	2	black ::  This color (black) will help the dog house stay/become warmer. Since the dog house is outside, and for the most part its pretty cold outside, the dog house should be black, so that the dog who lives in the dog house can stay warm. Black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, black was the darkest color and had an average temperature of 53 degrees Celcius. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, white was the lightest color and had an average temperature of 42 degrees Celcius. So this proves that the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb, making the object warmer.
26697	10	0	0	black :: the color will keep the dog house cooler in t he hot sumer
26698	10	1	1	dark gray ::  dark gray because it will attrac enough heat to keep it warm in the dog house.
26699	10	0	0	white :: I pick this color because its so bright.
26700	10	0	0	dark gray ::  The color wuld keep the dog house at a even t empature but it wouldnt really matter because its not a closed system. th e jar had a lid so it left in heat ,but a dog house would let the heat ou t so the dog house is a open system.
26701	10	2	2	white :: The tempreture inside the white doghouse will be much cooler then the air tempreture outside. Because in the experimen t, the results from all the testing showed that the white colored lid was much cooler the the rest of the colors used, so it would be more reasona ble to use the white colored paint to paint the doghouse.
26702	10	1	1	light gray :: it will keep it warm in the winter but in the summer it would keep it cool because it is a light gray
26703	10	2	2	black :: If they choose to paint the dog house black, it will affect it by absorbing more heat energy. In the investigation, th e average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG)C versus the white wh ich had an average of 42(DEG)C. Therefore, if Brandi and Jerry paint t he dog house black, it will absorb more heat energy than the other colors .
26704	10	2	2	light gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be light grey. This because the light grey would keep the dog house not a s hot during like the summer, and warm enough during the winter. From Bra ndi and Jerry's previous experiment, you can see with darker colors on th e lids like black and dark grey it made the jar temperature hotter so if you used it on the dog house it would make it too warm inside. With the l ight grey it would be not to hot or cold. Another choice would be the whi te but that might make the dog house to cold in the winter, so light grey is the best choice.
26705	10	1	1	white ::  it asorb less heat
26706	10	1	1	black :: the color would keep the dog house warmer bec use the average was 53 minutes after the light was turned off, so the dog would stay warmer compared to white which was only and average of 42 min utes after the light turned off.
26707	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be the best color for the do ghouse because it would not be too hot or too cold because in the expiram ent, the jar with light gray lid had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C after 10 minutes under the heat lamp which was not as cold as the white l id (42(DEG)C) and the light grey lid did not have as hot of an average a ir temperature after 10 minutes under the heat lamp as the dark gray lid (48(DEG)C) or the black lid which was 53(DEG)C. With the light grey roo f, the dog would not get too hot or too cold in it's doghouse.
26708	10	2	2	white ::  It was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature. It was 42(DEG)C, 43(DEG)C, 41(DEG)C, and 42(DEG)C.
26709	10	2	2	black :: The color black, might affect the inside of t he doghouse because the color black absorbs more energy compared to the o ther colors. I think this because in the data from the experiment, the av erage air temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes for the lid color black was 53(DEG)C. The Dark gray lid colors average air temperatu re inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 48(DEG)C, the air temperat ure for light gray was 45(DEG)C, and the average air temperature for the lid color white was 42(DEG)C. Overall, the conclusion you could draw fr om that data is that the lid color black did absorb more energy than the other colors. In the experiment the black lid had a difference in average s from the coldest air temperature (the white lid) by 11(DEG)C.
26710	10	0	0	light gray :: maybe something else was alredy that color
26713	10	1	1	white :: That color will effect the doghouse because t he doghouse will not be hot in the summer it will stay cool in the there.
26714	10	1	1	black ::  black if you live in a cold place and want th e dog house to stay warm.
26716	10	1	1	black ::  In the summer the dog house will be hot but in the winter the dog house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat.
26717	10	1	1	white ::  i choose white because if it was black,dark g ray, or light gray it will get hoter because of the density of hot ness.
26718	10	0	0	dark gray :: Because dogs can only see light gray or dark gray and its more easyer for him to see his dog house?
26719	10	0	0	black :: the color might affect the dog house because it is a dark color.....
26721	10	1	1	black :: Black would be a good because it is a dark co lor and dark colors absorbe heat so when the dog house is made it will be warm for the dog.
26722	10	0	0	white :: white
26723	10	0	0	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be the best for the lids to m ake it sleeping light
26724	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray is not too cold but not too hot . Remember , most dogs have alot of hair on their bodys to keep them warm. &amp; so you dont want a dog house that gets too hot , like the black dog house , cause the sun obsorbs in darker colors. If a dog gets too col d in the dog house , provide blankets , food , &amp; water . For a health y envoirment. Also , if you see its a nice day outside , let the dog play aroud dont make it get cooped up inside .
26725	10	1	1	white :: If you painted the dog house white, it would keep the dog cooler than if you were to paint the dog house black because the color black attracts heat more than the color white does, so if you painted it black, the dog would be really warm.
26727	10	1	1	light gray :: You'd probably want a light gray so that in t he summer the house is cool, and in the winter its warm
26728	10	0	0	dark gray :: it wwould make the dog house a good temperatu re
26729	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray doesnt wont make the dog house, to o hot or too cold. The dog house would be both warm and cool down.
26730	10	0	0	dark gray ::  Dark gray is best because the temperature sta ys the same
26732	10	1	1	dark gray :: I would say dark gray because if it was cold it would keep the doghouse warm and if it was hot the doghouse wold be wa rm inside.
26733	10	1	1	dark gray :: cause darker the color more it atracts heat
26734	10	2	2	light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse li ght grey, because light grey absorbs more heat than white, but it absorbs less heat than black and dark grey. Light gray would be perfect, because during the summer, the light gray would absorb some heat but not alot, s o the doghouse would'nt be too warm. During the winter, the light gray wo uld absorb some heat so that the doghouse wont be too cold during the win ter. I know this because in the experiment that Brandi and Jerry did (whe re they found out how the color of an object affects its temperature) the y found that the average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid after 10 minutes was 53(DEG)C. The average temperature of the glass jar with the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48(DEG)C. The average temper ature of the glass jar with the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45(DEG) C. Finnaly, the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid after 1 0 minutes was 42(DEG)C. This shows that light gray absorbs some heat, bu t not alot, so Light gray would be the perfect color for a doghouse.
26735	10	1	1	white :: If the color white is used on the dog house, it would reflect the suns light causing the inside of the dog house to be cooler than if it was painted with a darker colored paint.
26736	10	1	1	white :: white would best fit the dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm.
26737	10	2	2	dark gray ::  The dark gray would be better for the dog hou se because its not to hot but not to cold. The black would be to ho t becuse the average was 53(DEG)c but the light gray and white are to cold with the light gray's average at 45(DEG)c and white at 42 (DEG)c. So in this case the dark gray is the right color fot the dog house with the average of 48(DEG)c.
26738	10	0	0	black :: how hot it will get
26740	10	0	0	white :: They Should Paint the Dog house White. If The Dog House Was whiteAnd It was a sunny day, then the dog would be hot.(do gs cant sweat.)
26741	10	2	2	black :: Black will be a good color for the dog house because it attracts heat and it will kep the dog warm in its dog house. T he average temperature for the color black is 53 degrees and the average temperature for the lightest color, white, is 42 degrees, though black is better because it is a warmer color and the dog should rather be warm ra ther than cold.
26742	10	1	1	dark gray ::  it will not make it too hot for the dog or to cold for the dog
26743	10	1	1	white :: the darker the coler the hotter the air in th e dog house
26744	10	1	1	white :: White would be a good color for the dog house because it doesn't absorb as much heat as black. This would make it cool er so the dog wouldn't be too hot
26745	10	2	2	black :: If it is cold outside and there is still some sun, the color would absorb the sun, making the dog house a little warme r for the dog to stay in. Giving a dog a wamer atmosphere would be better to have it cold and freezing. Brandi and Jerry did an experiment wh ere they tested colors (black, dark gray, light gray &amp; white) and bla ck had an average of 53 degrees C. While comparing to the white which was 42 degrees C, that is 12 degrees apart from the black.
26746	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would keep the doghouse warm but not to wa rm because dark gray is a dark color
26747	10	1	1	white :: i think that white would effect the dog house because it had the lowest numbers in the data table
26748	10	0	0	light gray :: The light gray color will keep the room bothe cool and warm at the same time
26749	10	2	2	light gray ::  black absorbs more heat, therefore it will be too warm in the dog house, white on the other hand absorbs less heat as you can see on the data table. During trial 1 white was 42(DEG) while black was 54(DEG). So if the roof is white the dog will too cool. Therefore th e dog house should be light grey, it is a happy medium. On cool days it w ill still be warm because grey absorbs more heat than white, and on hot d ays it wont be too hot because grey absorbs less heat then black.
26752	10	2	2	black ::  If the paint on the doghouse is black then the inside of the doghouse will be warmer. The air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it. the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse.
26753	10	0	0	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house because in all the trials the dark gray lid changed the air temperature in the jar to 48(DEG)C. The light gray lid change the air in the jar to 44(DEG)C in the first trial, 45(DEG)C in the second trial, and 46(DEG)C in the third trial. Dark gray would kepp the doghouse the s ame temperature where as the light grays temperature would vary.
26754	10	1	1	white :: if you have a white houes les heat will be at racted to the houes because it is a lighter color but to a dlack houes mo re heat will be atracted
26755	10	1	1	black ::  it will make the air inside the dog house war mer if the color is darker
26756	10	1	1	light gray :: The color might affect the dog house becuase dark colors attrack sunlight so black would be hotteer then dark gray, wo uld be hotter then light gray, and light gray would be hotter then white. White would have the coldest tempature in the dog house and black would be the hottest.
26757	10	1	1	white ::  white would be the best choice for the dog ho use because dark colors like black and dark gray absorb a lot of energy a nd it will be hotter, so therefor make a white doghouse and the dog would be in cooler temp
26758	10	1	1	light gray ::  Well darker colors absorb more heat,making the dog house a lighter color will keep it cool,but also warm but not to warm
26759	10	2	2	white :: white because, the jar with the white jar lid stayed the coolest and only got up to about 42(DEG)c. so the dog house would stay cooler if you painted it white.
26760	10	1	1	black :: black will affect the dog house becouse black attracts the sun wich makes lots of heat and high temperature
26762	10	1	1	black :: black because dark colors absorb more energy
26763	10	1	1	white :: because thee adrker the color of something th e more heat is attracted to it.
26764	10	1	1	light gray :: Its the median tempurature from the experimen t, so the doghouse temurature would be able to stay warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather.
26765	10	1	1	light gray :: The color will keep the dog warmer in the win ter, but won't make the dog house hot in the summer.
26766	10	1	1	dark gray :: Using the dark gray paint would be best becau se it was closest to the average temperature of all of the colors. The do ghouse temperature would be warm, which is good for the winter and most s easons.
26767	10	2	2	black ::  Black paint well keep the doghouse warmer because the black lid was avaraged 54(DEG)C ware as white paint was only 42(DEG)C. So there would be an avarge of about 12(DEG)C diffence b etween the white and black paint.
26768	10	2	2	black ::  the darker the color, the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer. and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest. the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
26770	10	0	0	light gray ::  black is too dark and it will make the dog de peress and the white is too light it will be dirty so soon so gray color will not make it dirty soon and depress. it will make the dog hyper and m ore excited.
26771	10	1	1	dark gray :: because it gives the inside of the doghouse a warm felling inside that would confret the dog
26772	10	2	2	white ::  The color white would be the best choice when painting a doghouse because it would keep the dogs cooler on when inside than any of the other color choices. The average temperature when testing white paint in the experiment was 42(DEG) C. Which is 11(DEG)C cooler than if you would have chosen black paint which has an average of 53(DEG)C. Proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best choice.
26773	10	0	0	black :: it will make it absorb more enerrgy ,
26775	10	2	2	white :: The white will keep the doghouse cooler when it is hot outside. Since the temperature was lowest when the white lid wa s on the jar the temperature in the doghouse will be cooler with a white doghouse.
26776	10	2	2	white :: Because it does'nt get as hot at black, dark grey, or light gray, the avrage for the white lid is 42(DEG)c, the avera ge for the black is 53(DEG)c, the average for the dark grey is 48(DEG)c , and the average for the light grey is 45(DEG)c so there for white is t he best color for the dog house because it doesnt get as hot as the other colors
26777	10	2	2	white :: the inside of the dog house will be cooler be cause white had the lowest tempature. at 42 degrees celsius
26778	10	0	0	white :: well dogs like light color so they will use i t more often.
26779	10	1	1	white ::  White might be the best color for the doghous e because of its low heat intake. With the dog having long hair it wouldn't be the best decision to have aa black doghlouse where it would a lways get hot. So, with a white doghouse the dog could be more comfortabl e in a less hot doghouse.
26780	10	1	1	dark gray ::  If Brandi and Jerry made a doghouse, the best color to paint it would be dark gray. Dark gray would be best because it absorbs heat so the dog won't be cold if it goes inside, but it isn't as dark as black so if the dog wants to be cooler, it can use the doghouse.
26781	10	0	0	dark gray :: The dog house would not be too hot in the sum mer if you did a dark gray, also if you chose a light gray it could be co ld in the winter, so there for dark gray would be the best color.
26782	10	2	2	white :: The doghouse should be white because then the temperature inside the doghouse would not rise as much on a sunny day because accoring to experiment and the data table, "Lid Color vs. Air Temperature," the glass jar with the white lid was the least affecte d by light. For example, the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid after ten minutes was 42(DEG)C, while the average temperature inside the glass jar with the black lid after ten minutes was 53(DEG) C.
26783	10	1	1	white :: The color white may affect the dog house beca use during the summer it may reach high temperatures and the color white refflects the sun. Making the dog house less hot.
26784	10	2	2	white :: the average air temperature of the jar with a white lid was 41(DEG)C. with the paint color as white the air temperatu re in the doghouse won't get as hot. With a black lid in the previous exp eriment the average air temperature was 53(DEG)C which is hotter than th e white lid by 12(DEG)C.
26785	10	1	1	light gray ::  so it won't get to hot or too cold
26786	10	0	0	white ::  It woulod affect the temperature inside of it .
26787	10	1	1	white ::  because it is said to no contract heat or ab sorb
26788	10	0	0	white :: i chose white cause it is the lightest color out of all fur of them and the other ones will just attract heat and the sun.
26789	10	1	1	light gray :: it would affect the dog house by keeping it cool. A dog that is active and does a lot of running, the dog would not want to got to a doghouse that is painted black because that would attract a lot of heat to the point where the dog would stay too hot to cool off.
26790	10	1	1	black :: it would keep the dog house warm becaus e the color will atract the heat wich will keep the house warm.
26791	10	1	1	white ::  This color won't make the doghouse to hot, to the highest temperature. The temperature of the white doghouse will be just right on a dog, especially after more than 10 minutes.
26792	10	1	1	dark gray :: According to the experiment, BLACK would be t he best and most effecient color (in the pretense that you would want it to be warm inside the doghouse, that is). But, the case is, during the summer, it gets very warm, and what happens if you paint the dog's house BLACK? Well, that col or magnifies the sun's heat, and you would indirectly scorch your poor do g. Usually, though, the heat here is cold and not hot, so the best color for the dog house would be DARK GRAY, because during the Summer and heat, your dog wouldn't be too h ot, and during the colder times, it will still keep the heat in well.
26793	10	2	2	white :: If the color of the doghouse is white, this w ill keep the house cool. According to the experiment, the black lid incre ased the air temperature by 29(DEG)C in 10 minutes, while the white lid only increased it by 18(DEG)C.
26794	10	1	1	dark gray :: The darker a color is the more heat energy it attracts, so the dark grey would attract not much heat energy to where its to hot, but it wont be to cold either.
26795	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think dark gray would be the best color for the dog house because out of all the other colors, this was the only one with the same temperature throughout the trials. it wouldn't be too cold or too hot.
26796	10	0	0	black :: The color may effect the dog house because it darker then any other other color
26797	10	1	1	white :: white will keep the dog house cold.
26798	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for the doghouse because the lighter the color is the less light it will attract.The reason black,dark grey,or light grey wouldn't work is in the table it shows for the averages, black is 53 and that is just to high,dark gray is 48 and that is also pretty warm,light gray is 45 and that is a little cooler th an the dark gray but noy much,and then it shows white,and white is 42 and that was the coolest of all the colrs bucause is attracted less heat.
26799	10	2	2	white :: by painting the doghouse white it would make the doghouse cooler inside than painting it black dark gray or light gray because in the data it shows that the average temperature of the air in the jar that had the white lid was 42(DEG)c , and the average temprature for the air inside the jar that had the black lid was 53(DEG)c. by painting the doghouse white there would be a difference in heat of 11(DEG)c t han painting the doghouse black. therefore painting the doghouse white would be the best choice of color to paint the doghouse because it would keep it the coolist temperature.
26800	10	2	2	white ::  If the doghouse is white, it will not become as hot as if it were painted black. The jar with the black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C under the lamp. However, the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C
26801	10	2	2	black ::  I think the black paint would work best becau se it absorbed the most heat out of the four colors. The average temperat ure was 53 degrees which was five degrees higher than the dark gray, eigh t degrees higher than the light gray, and eleven degrees higher than the white paint.
26803	10	2	2	white :: the white paint would make the inside of the dog house cool and not hot becuse dark colors absorb more energy as said in the text and bright colors don't.
26804	10	1	1	white ::  The white would make it cooler inside so in t he summer it wouldn't be hot
26805	10	2	2	white ::  You should use white because the dog probibly has enough fur to last through winer so you would want to keep as much h eat out as possible during the summer-I say this because according to the test reasults the average air heat from black was 53(DEG)C, the average for dark gray was 48(DEG)C, The average for light gray was 45(DEG)C an d the average for white was 42(DEG)C. So in conclution the white paint i s 11(DEG)C cooler than black paint. -
26806	10	1	1	white ::  White has the least air temperature (42) and so there will be less air temperature affecting on the doghouse.
26807	10	1	1	black ::  black because the coloe might get lighter and then darker and then lighter and then darker, it will affect the doghous e because the house may become warm inside by the heat the black is bring to it
26808	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dark gray will be a cooling and warming c olor for the doghouse. In all 3 trials it only got up to be 48(DEG) C an d the black got up to 54(DEG) C
26809	10	1	1	white :: It affects the inside of the dog house becaus e if white is the color outside then on the inside it will be much cooler than black or d ark gray since darker colors aborb more heat.
26810	10	1	1	light gray :: The color would affect the doghouse by not ge tting to hot in th summer and not getting to cold in the winter .
26811	10	2	2	white :: the white whould not be hot so the dog can no t burn up. the temperatre was 42(DEG) and the hight was the black at 53(DEG) . the diffentcies would be 11(DEG).
26812	10	2	2	black :: That color wil affect the doghouse warming th e inside of the doghose because in the data the color black was ranging i n from 52(DEG)C-54(DEG)C and the lighter colors were in the 40(DEG)C
26813	10	0	0	light gray :: its best. its not that dark and that light.
26814	10	2	2	white :: It will keep the Dog cooler in the summer. In each Test, the white lid was proven to stay the coolest, the data shows that white has the lowest temperatures at; 42 for trial 1, 43 for trial 2 , 41 for trial 3, and 42 for trial 4.
26815	10	0	0	black ::  it was hotter outside
26816	10	0	0	white ::  the white is not dark and not light, white is between that .
26817	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gary might affect the doghouse by keepin g it hot in the winter but not to hot in the summer
26818	10	1	1	black :: The black will absorb more enery
26819	10	1	1	light gray :: Its a lighter color and then it wont be that hot.
26820	10	2	2	black ::  Black would be the best choice in colder clim ates (Washington) because it absorbs more heat. The dog would thusly be w armer if its doghouse was painted black. Inside the jars, blacks av erage temperature is 53(DEG)C, compared with white which's average tempe rature was 42(DEG)C. That is a difference of 11(DEG)C.
26821	10	2	2	black ::  If you use the color black, then the inside o f the doghouse will have an increase in temperature. According to the exp eriment a Black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C. While t he white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. Therefore I can conc lude that a darker color will cause an object to have a higher tempature. Which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature then a white doghouse.
26822	10	0	0	black ::  Black affects the doghouse because is gonna b e to dark and hes not gonnaq want to stay in ther.
26823	10	1	1	white :: How the color white would effect the dog house is, if they painted it white it would be cooler inside the dog house. and if they painted it black it would be hotter. they should paint the dog house white so the affect makes the dog house cooler.
26824	10	2	2	black :: In the experiment the black lid made the air hotter so to make the doghouse hot they should use the black lid for the lamp.
26825	10	1	1	black ::  because in the winter the dog has a beter chance of staying warm
26826	10	1	1	white ::  White will not affect the doghouse because th e sun will not go to the doghouse as black because black absoed more the energy so the godhouse will get hot as much as the coloer black.
26828	10	2	2	white ::  Having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler. This is because white is a color that doesn't absorb heat as well as other colors which will make the doghouse cooler and more comfertable for the dog. In the expiriment the air temperature inside the jar was 11(DEG)c cooler than the jar that was black which proves that painting the doghouse white will make the doghouse cooler.
26829	10	1	1	black :: the sun will absorb the color black and the t emperature will rise
26830	10	0	0	light gray :: this color would give the temperature a fresh breeze in the hot summer days &amp; the fall
26831	10	0	0	black :: the dog would not be ale to see his house in the dark.
26833	10	1	1	white :: I don't think the color on the outside would affect the inside of a doghouse if your using a thicker material like wood, but to be safe i would still choose white so the house would be colder
26834	10	2	2	black :: Black will affect the dog house by making it hotter because the average temperature inside the dog house was 53(DEG) c. The white will will not make it as hot because it's average temperatur e was 42(DEG)c.
26835	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I think that they should paint the dog house black because it absorbs more sunlight and allow the house to be warmer. The black had the highest temperture that was 54 degrees and the white on e had 41 degrees.
26836	10	1	1	white ::  white, might make it colder in the winter tha n the spring ,black might it hot in the summer and winter the light gray as well
26837	10	1	1	white ::  Since white is such a light color it doesnt a bsorb so much energy and it's cooler than the other colors. Cooler condit ions are best for a dog, in my opinion.
26838	10	2	2	white :: the white paint will keep the dog warm but no t stifling hot. the paint had the lowest temp. of air in the lab as white doesn't attract heat like black does
26839	10	2	2	white ::  White paint will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler than it would be if the doghouse was a different color. In the experiment, the white color had the lowest temperature, after 10 minutes, and was 42(DEG)C. The light gray was 45(DEG)C, the dark gray was 48(DEG)C, and the black was 53(DEG)C. Since the white had the lowest temperature, it would keep the doghouse coolest, and therefore be the best to use.
26840	10	1	1	light gray :: the light gray because than i wont get to hot in the doghouse when its sunny out side because it wont absorb to much e nergy, but when its cold outside it will still be a little warm because i t absorbing energy, so it would always be the perfect temperature for the dog
26841	10	0	0	white ::  because the whit well not be as heated in the dog house unlike black because that welll heat the whole doghouse
26842	10	1	1	white ::  Brandi and jerry should use white because it absorbs less heat than the darker colors.
26843	10	2	2	dark gray :: The color might affect the doghouse by making the inside temmperature warmer than the temperature outside by more than it would if you used white, or light grey. because in the experiment, th e dark grey absorbed more heat, getting an average of 48 degrees C. compa red to light grey's 45 degrees and whites 42. Black absorbs more energy, at about 53 degrees C., but the dog might cook if its sitting in the dog house during the summer.
26844	10	1	1	white :: because if u have a lighter color then the temperture would be colder
26845	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light grey because the inside of the dog house wouldn't be too hot for the dog, or too cold. According to the data, the result of light grey had an average temperature of 45(DEG) C w hile the black paint would be too hot at an average of &#8776; 53(DEG) C and the white paint could maybe be too cold with an average temperature of 42(DEG) C
26846	10	0	0	light gray :: If darker colors absorb more heat, then I'm g uessing that that means it absorbs cold temperatures too. So to keep it a t an even balance, I would say the color light gray is the best choice.
26847	10	2	2	black :: Painting the dog house black would make the a ir inside it warmer. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment, the average air te mperate of the can with a black lid was 53(DEG)C, whereas the dark gray was only 48(DEG)C, the light gray was only 45(DEG)C, and the white lid was only 42(DEG)C. Therefore, the black lid made the air the warmest so a doghouse painted black will have the warmest inner temperature.
26848	10	2	2	white ::  If the color of the doghouse is white, then i t would be colder inside the dog house and when it is warm and sunny outs ide the dog in the doghouse will not get to hot. The results from the exp eriment support my desicion because in the experiment with a white lid th e temperature inside the glass jar was 42(DEG)C and all the other temper ature averages were a higher temperature than 42(DEG)C.
26850	10	1	1	black ::  It would affect it by making the dog house more warm when the sun is out. The reason I would use this color is because when its cold outside during the day, the black will absorb more energy from the sun and make it warmer for the dog.
26851	10	1	1	black :: in the daytime the dog house will be warmer
26852	10	0	0	white :: This color through off more heat than the res t of them.
26853	10	1	1	white :: This color might affect the doghouse because the doghouse might stay cool for the dog and they wont burn up in the dar k colors.
26854	10	1	1	light gray ::  During the summer, the doghouse will stay a l ot cooler than it would with it painted black, but in the winter, it woul d be better to have light gray so that the doghouse would be warmer.
26855	10	1	1	white ::  i would choose white because you don't want t he dog to get too warm.
26856	10	1	1	black :: that color might affect the dog house because it will keep the dogs warm at night in case of the cold air. for example if it was hot and i was wearing black i would be hot as well cause its a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat on me and in t he air.
26857	10	0	0	light gray :: i dnt know
26858	10	1	1	light gray :: It will asorb some heat into the dog house, s o that the dog could stay warm at most times.
26859	10	2	2	white ::  If the doghouse was painted white, in the sum mer when it was very hot outside, then the dog would be able to go into t he doghouse where it would be cool inside. I know this because in the exp eriment the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatures. The ligh ter the color, the cooler it will be inside.
26861	10	0	0	black :: bacause its black
26862	10	2	2	light gray ::  I chose light gray because then the dog house won't be too cold or too warm with light gray. Light gray was in the mid dle of the data. White would of been too cold for the dog but black would of been too hot. The average temperture for white was 42(DEG)C and the average temperture for black was 53(DEG)C. Light gray was the perfect ch oice because it's average temperture is 45(DEG)C.
26864	10	2	2	white :: the best color to paint the dog house would b e white because it attracts the less heat in the trials the tempatures we re 42(DEG), 43(DEG), 41(DEG), and 42(DEG) which makes it the lowest t empatures out of all the colors
26865	10	1	1	black ::  it might effect it,by using this color it can make the doghouse more warmer on summer days.
26866	10	1	1	white ::  well when it gets hot in the summer the dog w ill be cooler and white goes with everything.
26867	10	0	0	white :: white would reflect heat so the dog would not get verry hot
26868	10	0	0	light gray :: they might not beabol to see the thing
26869	10	0	0	dark gray :: that would help even it out.
26870	10	2	2	white :: White, because you want your dog to be cool e nough and according to the "Lid color vs. Air tempature inside glass jar" chart, white is the coolest.
26871	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I think that the color dark grey will affect the doghouse by making it warmer but not too warm inside, than if it was a lighter or darker color. I think that because in the experiment the darkest color black ended up being the warmest at 53(DEG), dark grey was the second warmest at 48(DEG), light grey was next at 45(DEG), and white was least warmest at 42(DEG).
26872	10	2	2	white :: I would paint the doghouse white because that color would keep the doghouse cool. In the experiment, the jar with the white lid was an average temperature of 42(DEG)C and the jar with the bl ack lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C.
26873	10	2	2	white ::  They should make the dog house with a white r oof because that will keep the inside of the dog house cool, instead of e xtremely hot. In their experiment the average for a white lid was 42(DEG) C, as apposed to the black lid which had an average of 53(DEG)C. It would be a lot smarter to keep the inside of the doghouse cool by using white paint so the dog has some where to cool off, instead of using black paint so i t is very hot in the dog house and the dog will not want to be inside of the dog house at all.
26874	10	1	1	black ::  because when is sunny the inside the doghouse is going to be so hot
26875	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think dark gray is good because the t empeture is 48(DEG) and that's not hot so the dog is not going to be hot .And 48(DEG) is not cold either it's cool so the dog wont be cold or hot it'll be just right.But that's my opinion.
26876	10	2	2	black :: If they were to paint the dog house black the n the dog would stay warm. As in the experiment it shows that when they used the b lack lid, the temperature went from 24(DEG)C to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. And when they used the white lid the tempurature went from 24(DEG)C to 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This showes that the darker the color, the great er increase in the air temperature, because the darker colors absorb more energy.
26877	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would effect it because in the doghouse it wouldn't be too hot and it woul dn't be to cold.
26878	10	1	1	white :: the color white would keep the dog house at a cooler temperature
26879	10	1	1	dark gray :: How this color might affect the dog house is that with Black in the summer the dog house would get to hot inside, and with white in the winter time it would get to cold inside. I chose Dark Grey because it would not get to hot or to cold because of the weather.
26880	10	1	1	black ::  black would affect the doghouse because if it was to hot the dog wouldnt have know where to go but the doghouse the the dog house would be extremely hot
26881	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark gray because that color doesnt absorb to much sun to make it hot and it doesnt absorb not enough sun to make it t o cold.It absorbs just the right amount of sun so that its not to hot and not to cold.
26882	10	0	0	black :: blach dontueist nating
26883	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray should be the cooler because in th e summer it wont be so hot because in the data the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so it's not to hot or to cold.
26885	10	1	1	white ::  You would want to paint it white beacuse white does not absorb as much heat as daker colors would, therefor; keeping the dog cooler in the summer time.
26886	10	2	2	white :: In the trails, the white lid got the least ho t, so the dog house does not get to hot, they should paint it white.
26887	10	0	0	black ::  It would have more air in the doghouse allowi ng the dog to breath easier.
26888	10	1	1	white ::  reflect more heat to keep the inside cooler i n the sumer
26889	10	2	2	black :: Black would change the temperature of the dog house by making it warmer beacause black absorbs heat to most. With the black lid the temperture was 53(DEG)C. With the white lid the temperature was 42(DEG)C. There was 11(DEG)C difference.
26890	10	2	2	white :: i would say white because in the experiment t he darker the color the hotter it got. And with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot.
26891	10	0	0	white :: Because dog likes to touch things so they mit e do something and make the lamp fall.
26893	10	0	0	dark gray ::
26895	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color light gray would have to be the be st color to paint the doghouse. They wouldnt want to use black because si nce black is a dark color itll absorb more energy &amp; make the air temp erature rise high. So black wouldnt be a good color because they wouldnt want the dogs to get to hot. That is why i chose light gray because i thi nk its just righ to paint the doghouse. With light gray, the dogs wouldnt be to hot or too cold. They would be just right.
26896	10	0	0	dark gray :: when it rains or gets cold the doghouse will be warm and if it hot our the dog can be in some shade
26897	10	1	1	white :: it would make it cooler cause the color isnt dark.
26898	10	1	1	light gray :: it is not too hot or too cold
26899	10	1	1	dark gray :: It might affect the doghouse by adding heat , but not too much heat and the temperature will stay the same throught th e day when the sun hits on it . It would be a good coloring because you d ont want the dog to get too hot .
26901	10	2	2	black :: Black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest of all the paint colors. In the experiment it shows that with a black lid on a glass jar, the air temperature will be 53 (DEG)C on average and with a white lid, the air temperature would be 42 (DEG)C on average. This shows that the black lid made the air warmer by 11(DEG)C and therefore black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest.
26902	10	2	2	white :: That color might help to keep the air tempera ture lower since lighter colors dont absorb as much energy as darker colo rs like black or gray. This was proven in the experiment because the aver age air temperature for white (42(DEG)) was lower than the average tempe rature for black and gray (45(DEG)- 53(DEG)).
26903	10	1	1	light gray :: I think the best paint color is light gray be cause that way the temperature inside the doghouse will be warmer than th e outside, so it won't be too cold inside, but it won't be too hot like a black roof might cause it to be
26904	10	1	1	black ::  so it would keep it warmer in the winter and warm in the soummer so the dog wouldent freeze at night
26905	10	2	2	white :: A white doghouse would absorb less energy, an d its temperature would be cooler. In the experiment, the jar with the li ght, white lid had a lower temperature than the jar with the darkest, bla ck lid. A dog house painted white would therefore have a lower temperatur e, and the dog could use it to stay out of the sun, and cool in summer.
26906	10	1	1	light gray :: that color will not effect the doghouse becau se the light gray will not be to cold or to hot the the doghouse and for the dog who is going to be there in the doghouse
26907	10	1	1	black ::  The doghouse would be hotter because dark col ors (like black) abosorb heat.
26908	10	2	2	black ::  The color "Black" would be the best color for the roof of a dog house because according to the results from the experiment, the air temperature inside is higher compared to other co lors.
26909	10	2	2	black :: black would be good for a doghouse roof becau se in brandi and jerrys trials black heats up the warmest with black at a n average of 53(DEG) and the onther three colors only in the fortie(DEG) range. so therefore if you have a darker roof the doghousewill be warmer for t he dog.
26910	10	1	1	white ::  this color might affect the doghouse by keepi ng it cool inside for the dog when it gets to hot in the summer and wants to go somewere where its not so hot
26911	10	2	2	white :: the best color to paint the dog house would b e white because in the experiment the white lid didn't get as hot a s the black lid. the black lid reached an average of 53(DEG)c, but the w hite lid only reached 42(DEG)c. also with a white piant on the dog house instead of being really hot the dog house will be very cool
26912	10	0	0	black :: If the dog house was black it would attract m ore light from the sun to the dog house which would keep the dog warmer w hen its outside.
26913	10	2	2	white :: if they use the white paint for the dog house then on the inside of the dog house it wont be as hot as if it were pain ted black or the two shades of gray. the shades of gray and the black pai nt caused the jar to at least get up to 45(DEG)C and at the most the jar got to 53(DEG)C so brandi and jerry would be best of using the white pa int for the dog house because in the experiment the jar only got to 42(DEG) C when they used the white lid.
26914	10	1	1	dark gray ::  If the dog house is dark gray, then the house will absorb heat to keep the dog warm on cold nights but also not to muc h heat so that the dog stays cool on hot days, because the darker the col or the more heat that is absorbed. If the color is not completely black t hen not to much heat energy will be absorbed.
26915	10	1	1	white ::  white because dogs like to be cool like how they are always panting they do that so the cool down so if it was black then the dog would be way to hot.
26916	10	1	1	dark gray ::  By painting the doghouse dark gray, it would affect the inside of the house because it would keep it warm while not ov er heating it. However, if placed in an already warm outside temperature, the inside COULD in fact overheat. So a dark gray doghouse would be pref erable in a cooler enviroment.
26917	10	1	1	light gray ::  The dog house would not be hot, but it would not be too cold either.
26918	10	1	1	dark gray :: you want the doghouse to be hot but not too hot so dark grey is right in the middle
26919	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray should keep the dog house a medium temprature that isn't too hot, or to cold.
26920	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray would keep the doghouse warm so th e dog wont be cold but also at a reasonable temperature so that the dog wont be to hot.
26922	10	1	1	white ::  The colors affect the temperature of inside t he dog house because darker colors attract more heat than white. I chose white because it has the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)c. The ave rage of black was 53.25(DEG)c, dark gray 48(DEG)c, light gray 45(DEG)c , and white 42(DEG)c. All of this data was from the experiment. The diff erence is 11.25(DEG)c from lowest average to higest average.
26923	10	1	1	white :: If you paint it white it will attract less he at from the sun, and the dog will like it.....
26925	10	0	0	light gray :: light gray won't affect the dog house in any way.
26926	10	0	0	white :: i choose white because if it gets hot in the summer than the dog can over heat because they only swet on there nose an d paws
26927	10	0	0	light gray :: Light gray holds the same temprature of 48(DEG) every time
26928	10	0	0	white :: my dog like white
26929	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray will keep the inside of the dog house cool, but not to cold, and will keep it at a medium temperature for the dog. The data shows tha the light gray jar's average temperature was 45(DEG) C, while the black jar was 53(DEG) C, and the white jar is 42(DEG) C. So the gray i think is the most comfortable temperature for the dog.
26930	10	2	2	white ::  Because it had lowest temp after 10 minutes w hich is 42(DEG)C
26931	10	2	2	white ::  The color white is the color that got the low est air tempature on the Lid color vs Air Tempature inside Glass Jar, so it would keep the doghouse the coolest inside so the dog would be most co mfortable.
26932	10	2	2	white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse is white. This is because the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat. The dog wouldn't want a hot sweaty dog house. After 10 minutes of heat from the lamp, the inside air in the black colored jar had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C. But the white colored jar had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. The white colored doghouse is the best color for coolness instead of hot, moisty and sweaty.
26935	10	1	1	white :: White is the color most likely perfered becau se the color white doesnt absorb the suns radiations so it doesnt heat up as hot as others would.
26936	10	1	1	white :: painting the doghouse white will make the dog house absorb less heat, and the inside will stay cooler then if it were p ainted a darker color
26937	10	2	2	black :: The color black might affect the doghouse by making it warmer than using a lighter color like white, because black had an average temp of 53 degrees, and the color white had an average temper ature of 42 degress. Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer.
26938	10	2	2	white ::  If the dog house was painted white it would not get as hot on the inside on warm days. The average lowest temperature after 10 minutes a light was 42(DEG) with the white lid.
26939	10	0	0	dark gray :: Darker colors absorb more energy.
26940	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dog house would be warm because dark gray is in the middle of the temperature ranges when exposed to light and hea t.
26941	10	1	1	white :: it'll make the dog house a lot more cooler be cuase the lighter the color the less heat is attracted to it by the sun.
26942	10	1	1	white :: In the summer when its reqqally hot the white color will attract less heat therefore leaving the doghouse cooler.
26943	10	2	2	white :: I woul'd choose white because, The tempeture is cooler the average coming in a 42(DEG)c and the other ones are hotter like Light Gray is 45(DEG)c and Dark Gray is 48(DEG) and, Black at 53(DEG) .So i would have choose the coolest(least hottest) one so the dog would not get hot
26944	10	1	1	white :: using white as the color for the dog house ro of would be best beacuse the sun light isnt atracted to whight as it is b lack. so the dog will stay cool and not hot inside his house.
26945	10	2	2	white :: The color white will affect the doghouse in a good way. The color white dosn't absorb as much heat as the other colors do. When they did the experiment the color white only got to 42(DEG) C while the color black got to 53(DEG) C. Also, white turned out to be the color that absorbed the least heat of only 42(DEG) C. Which means insid e the doghouse it will stay nice and cool because it does't absorb as mu ch heat as the other colors do.
26946	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray because in the summer it will not ge ttoo hot and in the winter it will not get that cold.
26947	10	0	0	white :: Because the dog house won't get too warm and dogs have fur on them therefore they would not want there doghouse to get to warm.
26949	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would make it cooler in the summer and war m in the winter
26950	10	1	1	black :: it could make it to warm for the dog, it depends on the weather.
26951	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dark gray would probably be best for the doghouse because it absorbs heat but it still leaves out heat so when it is hot out, the doghouse won't absorb to much heat.
26952	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think that dark gray would be the best colo r to have on a dog hose because, the dark gray had a steady tepature on i t that wasnt to hot or to cold and if your a dog im sure you dont want to be cold at night and to hot during the day.
26953	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best color choice because in the experament white was the coolest color of an average of 42(DEG)C.
26954	10	2	2	white :: The lighter the color, the cooler the dog hou se will be causeing it to be more comfertable.The white lid was an averag e of 42(DEG)C 3(DEG)C coller than the other lids
26955	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color of the doghouse would keep it the right temperature, not to cold and not to warm.
26956	10	1	1	white ::  becuase from there experiment the white lid d idnt get that much heatlike the others
26957	10	1	1	white ::  The color will affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse colder. By painting the doghouse white the air temperature inside the doghouse will stay lower. Since white is a light color it will not absorb a lot of sun like the darker colors will.
26958	10	2	2	black :: Painting the doghouse black would cause the t emperature to increase the most. In the experiment the average air temper ature in the glass with the black lid was 53(DEG)C, the glass with the d ark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the glass with the light gray lid was 45(DEG) C and the glass with the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This proves that if Brandi an d Jerry wanted their doghouse to be warm they should use black paint. Oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse.
26959	10	1	1	black :: The black color would make the dog house warm er for the winter, so that the dog will stay warm.
26962	10	1	1	white ::  Because white doesn't attarct as much heat an d therefore the dog would be a lot cooler in a white dog house than a bla ck one for example.
26963	10	1	1	white ::  the color white will make it cooler in the do g house so the dog wont get hot with all the fur it has.
26964	10	2	2	white :: White would be the smarter choice, because it reflects heat verses absorbing it. According to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside. Having black roofing tiles would be smart as well, because during the day they would absorb heat and then at night when it cools down the doghouse is warm inside. Together these two colors would make a very comfortable house.
26965	10	2	2	white ::  I chose the color white for the doghouse. Thi s is because if the darker the color, the greater increase in temperature , then I would want to choose the lightest color so that the temperature of the inside of the doghouse would be cooler than the colors light gray, dark gray and black. This would help the dog stay cooler and not get as hot in the summer. The darker the color, the greater increase in temperat ure is correct because the average temperature of the inside of the jar w ith the black lid was 53(DEG) C when the average temperature of the insi de of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. The white lid jar was 11 (DEG) cooler than the black lid jar.
26966	10	1	1	black :: That color might affect the dog house because it will be really dark. And the tempeture will be really high.
26967	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I chose this color for the doghouse because s ince the doghouse will be located outside, you dont want the dog to be co ld at night! All dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways. The experiment with different colors of lids proved it did have an effect on the air te mperature inside the jar. The darker the lid, the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat. Which is why I chose dark gray for the doghouse. So its not too warm for the dog, but if the dog gets ho t, it can always come ourside of the doghouse and sleep.
26969	10	0	0	black :: it wont be as hot
26970	10	0	0	light gray :: it can effect the ray of the sun
26971	10	0	0	black :: i think it said the blacker the lid is the butter
26972	10	1	1	white :: you would probably want to choose white becua se that is the color that will keep it the coolest inside the dogouse, wh en the sun is shinning it is usually warm outside, and the dog will want to use it to cool off, not to get even more hot.
26973	10	2	2	white :: The color might affect the doghouse by keepin g it cool. In the experiment, white had the average of 42(DEG)C, as for black had an average of 53(DEG)C. Therefore, 42(white) is less than 53(b lack), so Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white.
26974	10	1	1	white :: The doghouse will be cooler and more comftera ble for the dog if it is white.
26975	10	0	0	black :: black absorbs all colrs and the data table sh ow that the average for black paint is 53 degrees
26976	10	2	2	white :: White was the lid color with the coolest temp erature after 10 minutes, painting the dog house white will keep the insi de of the doghouse cooler because white will reflect more of the sun's he at than say black paint. In other words the darker the color the more hea t it absorbs and transfers to the inside of the dog house. We want to kee p the dog house as cool as possible so that the dog doesn't over heat.
26977	10	1	1	white ::  The color might effect the doghouse by making it the temperature lower.
26978	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it will keep warm i n side but also it will keep cool when needed, so if its hot out side it will be warm but not to hot and if it's cold out side it wiill be cool bu t also warm as well. I know this because with the dark gray average tempe rature was 48 (DEG)c wich was a preet good median considering the black average was 53 (DEG)c and the white average was 42 (DEG)c.
26979	10	2	2	white ::  The color white would keep the dog house not as hot inside as the other colors, becasue white had the lowest temperature in the experiment. Whit had the lowest temperature average which was 42(DEG)C. Light gray's average was 45(DEG)C. Dark gray's average was 48(DEG)C. Black's average was 53(DEG)C. That shows us that white had the lowest temperature and will keep the dog house not as hot.
26980	10	2	2	light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house l ight gray. If the dog house is painted in light gray, the temperature ins ide the dog house would not be too hot or too cold. In the result shows t hat the air temperature with light gray lid is 45(DEG)C, with white it's 42(DEG)C, and with dark gray it's 48(DEG)C. Temperature with light gra y is warmer than white lid, but it's not too hot like the dark gray ones.
26982	10	1	1	black ::  it is warmer than other colors
26983	10	1	1	white :: white because blakc would absorb alot of the sun thermal energy witch would over heat and dehydrate the dog, same with , dark gray, and light gray, white would be the best choice because white reflects light, as appose to absorbing it, making the inner tempature co oler and more comfordable for the dog.
26984	10	1	1	light gray :: i choose light gray because it is not to cold anfd not to hot just right.If i choose a darker color it might get to ho t for the dog and if it is a really light color it will be to cold and wont ke3ep him warm.
26985	10	2	2	white :: The color white is the best choice. It will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture. This is proven by the data gathered by the trials. According to the data the average air temperature of a black lid on a jar was 53(DEG) C. When the lid was changed the white the temperature droped to an average of 42(DEG) C. This proves that white would be a better temperature control factor.
26986	10	2	2	black ::  Black would effect the dog house because it's a darker color and darker colors absorb heat which would make the dog ho use warmer inside. In the experiment when Brandi and Jerry put the black lid on ther jar the average temprature was53(DEG)c opposed to when they put thee white lid on the average temrature was only 42(DEG). In the end black would effect the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the dog house.
26987	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray will make the inside of the doghou se warm but not too hot, so in the winter a dog won't be cold but in summ er it won't be too hot either. 45(DEG)C is a good warm temperature and t he temperature inside the doghouse should remain that temperature unless the color is changed.
26988	10	1	1	light gray ::  It wont get as much heat as black because dar k colors absorb more heat then other colors.
26989	10	1	1	light gray :: light gray will keep the temperture of the d og house not to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter. if the d og house was white it would have a temerture average of 42(DEG)C and if the dog house was black it would have an average temerture of 53(DEG)C a nd the dark gray would be to warm as well at 48(DEG)C
26991	10	1	1	white ::  that color white will effect the heat because the light the color the less heat it will atract and so then the white w ill give off less heat and the dog will stay cool.
26992	10	2	2	black :: Black paint would warm the inside of the dogh ouse more than the other colors. In the experiment, black heated up an av erage of 53(DEG)C, while the other colors were never increased more than 48(DEG)C. If it was cold outside, that color would warm the doghouse mo re because of the low albedo and high absorbtion of energy.
26993	10	0	0	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house a dark gray because you dont want a lot of energy in you dog house, it sho uld be calm and relaxing but you always want some energy.The dark gray wi ll make he dog feel more relaxed, because in the experiment it says that the darker colors absorb more energy than the lighter colors.
26994	10	1	1	dark gray :: the dark gray color would absorbe more heat t han a white or light gray color, keeping the dog warmer, when the tempera ture is colder. But when the temperature is warmer outside it wont absorb e as much heat as the black would, keeping the dog cooler.
26995	10	2	2	white ::  this color would keep the dog house colder th an the other colors because from the recorded data, black's average temperature was 53 degrees celcius when white's was only 42 degrees celc ius
26996	10	1	1	white ::  WHite because It will make it a lot more cool temperature wise than if it were black because darker colors absorb a lo t more heat
26997	10	0	0	white :: Will they would like the dog to stay warm in his dog house and white dosent allow that much air to come in
26998	10	1	1	white ::  i would choose white because it attrackes les s heat to the dog house.
26999	10	0	0	black :: it will effect it because the suns rays will heat it
27000	10	1	1	black ::  it will make it very hot in the dog house
27002	10	1	1	white ::  They should paint the dog house white because if they would of painted i tblack it would attract more heat into the ho use and white does not attract heat or the sun light.
27003	10	1	1	white :: This might affect the inside of the dog house because darker colors absorb more energy from the sun, white would bring a minimum amount of heat.
27004	10	2	2	black :: If you paint the dog house black the dog hous e would be a little bit warmer in the winter the only bad part is that in the summer it will be a little hot inside the dog house. I know this bec ause in the experement that brandi and jerry did it said that the jar wit h the black lid was the hotest.
27005	10	0	0	dark gray :: Dark Gray would be a good color for a dog hou se because it will keep the dog house warm during the winter and during t he summer the dog will spend most of its time outside its house. the results in th e experiment were 48(DEG)C solid so that is a good temprature for a dog house. not too hot and not too cold.
27006	10	2	2	black ::  If they would like the dog to stay warmer, th ey should chose black because on average, the black lid had a higher temp urature than the white lid.
27007	10	0	0	light gray :: I choose light gray because it would be a nic e temperature. If the dog house was panted black the temperature would av erage 53(DEG) C. If it was dark gray the temperature would average 48(DEG) C. If the dog houyse was painted white then the temperature would average 42(DEG) C. But a light gray color would make the average tempurature a nice comfertable 45(DEG)C.
27008	10	0	0	light gray :: it well make it lighter so the dog can see mo re better.
27009	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because this will result in the doghouse being warm but not really hot. It really depends on where t he people live and on the season. Dark gray (48(DEG) C) would be more su itable because it would be pretty hot during summer but not as hot as the black (53(DEG) C), but it also would be warm during the winter, so it's a compromise between the weather. The temperature used for explanation w as the average.
27011	10	2	2	black :: If you painted the dog house black, the insid e would be hot. Because according to the experiment the color black would make things hot. The average for the temperature was 53(DEG)c for black . The average for dark gray was 48(DEG)C and gray was 45(DEG)C. Also wh ite was 42(DEG)C. According to this data, black would make things hot.
27012	10	2	2	white ::  having this colour will effect the dog house because light colours reflect heat, so if you paint the house white, then there wont as much heat on the walls, making the doghouse cooler. this i s shown by the fact that in the jar experement, black had the hottest dat a and white had the coolest.
27013	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray because it will not be to hot or c old
27014	10	1	1	white :: if they used white the doghouse would be cold er inside then it would if the doghouse was black. the reason why it woul d be colder is because white reflects more sunlight than the color black. darker colors usally abosord more heat then lighter colors.
27015	10	1	1	white ::  The darker the color, the greatest increase i n temperature because darker colors absorb more energy. The white would keep the doghouse's roof cool on a very sunny day, since the light color doesnt absorb energy as fast as the dark colors.
27016	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it would effect the dog house by not making the inside of it to hot or to cold. The average of the four averages was 47(DEG)c so i chose the closest one to 47(DEG) c and dark gray was 48(DEG)c so thats why i chose dark gray.
27017	10	0	0	black ::  the balck kid brings in the hot air and holds it. good conductor
27019	10	1	1	white :: White because black colors, dark colors attra cked heat towards them so if you get light color "white" the te mparture would be cooler in there.
27020	10	1	1	white ::  the tempicher will still rise but less then t he other ones
27021	10	1	1	white :: this might affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse cool inside during the summer.
27022	10	1	1	white :: White had the lowest average temperature so it would be more relaxing for the dog.
27023	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse. One way we know that is, when we did the expiriment with the lid colors, black ended up with an average tempature of 53 degrees celcius, w hile white ended up with 42 degrees celcius. This proves that black absor bs the most heat. If we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse.
27024	10	0	0	white :: white dosn't obsorb light how ever black dose
27025	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark Gray will affect the doghouse by making it warm in the doghouse. Not to cold like white or light gray and not too hot like the black.
27026	10	1	1	black ::  The darker the color that more heat it absorbs from the sun, which would make the dog house much warmer. They said, "becau se darker colors absorb more energy.".
27027	10	1	1	black :: black might affect the inside of the dog hous e because it will get really hot in the inside cause the sun will produce more heat on the darker color than the lighter colors.
27028	10	1	1	light gray ::  it would make it to where then in the summer it wouldnt be tohot but in the winter it wouldnt be to cold
27029	10	1	1	white ::  I would say that painting the dog house white would be the best option because white absorbs the leat amount of heat e nergy and since dog-houses are already small they are already hot and you don't want the dog to get overheated, plus dogs have lots of fur to keep them even warmer. If there is a chilly day in the winter, you can put a blanket inside to keep the dog warm, but I would say that altogether, whi te is the best choice.
27030	10	1	1	light gray :: The color Brandi &amp; Jerry should choose sh ould be light grey because if it was too dark, then the house would get t o hot, but if it was too light, it would be more cooler then the black, b ut it would be very dirty.
27031	10	1	1	white ::  If they choose white, then the increase in te mperature will be the lowest of all the colors.
27033	10	0	0	black :: black because it atracts sun and makes the do g house have more heat
27034	10	1	1	white ::  If they paint the dog house black or any dark color the dog house would be way to hot for the dog because the dark colors absorbe more heat then light colors.
27035	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would probly be the best color because its not black and its not white in the winter it can get really cold and white attracts less heat but in the summer it might be okay but black in the summer might be to much heat so to even things out i think dark gray is okay.
27036	10	1	1	black :: because the paint changes color thr hot ter it gets
27037	10	0	0	white :: i say white because the dog house is already going to be simi warm inside without the paint. and with the white paint the dog house is already like 40(DEG). so the sun shining on the dog hou se that would put the dog house at 80(DEG) inside during the day. then a t night the dog house will be in the 60s somewhere
27038	10	2	2	black :: The black paint will make the dog house warme r for the dog because the black lid on the jar aborbed the most heat, wit h the highest average temperature (53(DEG)C).
27039	10	2	2	black ::  I think black would be the best paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer when the sun is shining down on the doghouse. The average temperature for the color black was 53 degrees while the white color was only 42 degrees. Therefore, black is the better color to paint the doghouse.
27040	10	1	1	light gray ::  if the color was darker but not black it woul d keep the doghouse warmer but not making it to hot beacause like in the experiment it was warm but not hot!!
27041	10	1	1	light gray ::  i chose light gray because the inside of the doghouse would be warm and the dogs fur would keep the dog warm in the wi nter.
27042	10	2	2	white :: the white will affect the tempenture inside t he doghouse by making it cooler. the white absorbs less heat so it keeps more out of the doghouse allowing the dog to be more comfturable.
27043	10	0	0	dark gray :: AHAHA WHY ARE ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS SOO FREA KEN HARD AHAHA
27044	10	1	1	white ::  it will help keep the dog hose cool becus white atraks the least amont of heat
27045	10	2	2	black ::  the color mght affect the doghouse because brandi and jerry said that"darker colors absorb more energy (heat) " so a darker colors will make sure the dog is warm .
27046	10	0	0	black :: The darker color absorbs more energy
27047	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark Grey! because its not too dark so that t he dog gets to hot in the summer time but its not like it reflects the he at in the winter so the dog and stay warm. The average temp was 48(DEG) C so it was about the middle of the not to hot and not too cold.
27048	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I would use dark gray. The darker colors woul d keep the doghouse warmer. Black had an average of 53(DEG), whereas whi te had only 42(DEG). However, we must remember that a dog is a liv ing thing, and cannot overheat. Dark gray had an average of 48(DEG). Thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature. So, i n conclusion, I've determined that dark gray is the most logical choice.
27049	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because white would keep the do ghouse the coolest temperature. When they did the experiment, the black w as the hottest (53(DEG)c), the dark gray was in the middle (48(DEG)c), the light gray was also in the middle (45(DEG)c) and the white was the c oolest (42(DEG)c).
27051	10	2	2	white :: It Was The Coolest With the Temp. Of 42(DEG) C. It would Be To Hot To Use Black Which Was 53(DEG)C. Inside The Jar.
27052	10	1	1	white :: The color whit will keep the dog house coller , becuase the color whit deflects light better making the dog house cooler.
27053	10	1	1	light gray :: it would not make the doghouse too hot or too cold for the dog.
27054	10	1	1	white :: the lid color white could make a difference b etween the black lid. the tempurture could not be high so they must keep the temputure cool for the dog.
27055	10	1	1	white :: its would make the temperature inside the dog house not as hot so the dog does not overheat
27056	10	1	1	white ::  the color white might effect the dog house be cause it absorbs less sun light then black ,dark grey or light grey. what this would do is make it so it would not be to hot in the dog house
27057	10	2	2	black :: i chose the black color becasue that if the d og likes it hot then this would be the right becasue when they see what c olor would be the hotes and the trials number are 54(DEG), 52(DEG), 53(DEG) ((DEG)c) and the average temp. is 53(DEG)c if the dog likes it hot in there
27058	10	2	2	white :: Darker colors usually attract more light. By attracting more light, it usually makes things much warmer. So, if you ha ve the lightest color there is, then it would attract less light and make the doghouse cooler. According to the data, using a black lid made the j ar about 53 degrees, the dark gray made it about 48 degrees, the light gr ay made it 45 degrees, and the white was about 42 degrees. As you can see , the lightest color had the lowest temperature. So, by using the lightes t color, it would attract less heat so they should use the white paint.
27059	10	1	1	black :: A dark color like black will affect the insid e of the doghouse because the darker the color, the greater the increase in air temperature because darker colors absorb more energy.
27061	10	1	1	white :: The white color does not absorb as much energ y as black. In the doghouse the temperature will be about 42 (DEG)c when it is a sunny day.
27062	10	1	1	dark gray ::  First, where ever you live if it's always war m i would paint it light colored. But if the area you live in is always c old i would paint it a dark color. My theory is, your dog is going to sta y warm if the weather is always warm. Your dog will be warm during the da y or night when your dog house is a dark color. The dark color is going t o attract the energy.
27064	10	1	1	light gray ::  light grey would be good because it wouldnt g et hot in the sun and black would be bad becaus the sun would make it rea lly hot inside the dog house.
27065	10	2	2	black :: If they paint the doghouse black, their dog w ill always stay warm, because the color black will give the most heat. I know this because the average temperature in their experiment was 53(DEG) C and the others were in the low forty's.
27066	10	1	1	white :: this color might make the interior of the hou se cooler.
27067	10	1	1	white :: This color will be best because when its hot outside, the doghouse will be cooler than if they painted it black or a d arker color.
27068	10	1	1	black :: Black is a dark color so it will absorb more heat and make the dog house a hot temperature.
27069	10	0	0	black :: dfg
27070	10	1	1	dark gray ::  I think he wshould use the dark gray color to paint his house because, it will be kinda in the middle of the other tem petures. If they paint it white in the winter it might be colder because it does't attrack to much heat. If they pick black as the color it would be to hot in the summer because it attracks more heat. Light gray will ki nda be like if you paint it white. So I think you should paint it dark gray so that in summer it atracks some heat. And that in the winter it does too. So it would be even out in both summer and winter .
27071	10	1	1	white :: white wont effect the dog house because white dosnt absorb that much heat so the dog wont get so hot and not be able t o use the dog house
27072	10	1	1	dark gray :: if the dog house was painted black, the dog w ould get too hot in the summer time becuase the color black absorbs more energy. But if the dog house was painted white, the dog would be easily c old in the winter time because the color whit absorbs less energy. In con clusion, painting the dog house dark gray will attract the right amount o f energy for the dog.
27073	10	1	1	white ::  Because white reflects off the sun so it woul d keep the dog cooler instead of having a black roof that absorbs light a nd would keep the dog very hot.
27074	10	2	2	black :: I believe that the dog house should be painte d black because it can keep the dog house warm during the winter. The dat a shows that the inside of the glass jar was 53(DEG)C when the black lid was used. Using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in t he glass jar. A disadvantage would be that in the summer the dog house wi ll be too hot, but as for the winter the black is the correct choice.
27075	10	2	2	white :: The lighter the color the lower the temperatu re. The average temperature of the black lid after just 10 minutes was 53 (DEG), the average temperature for the dark gray lid after 10 minutes wa s 48(DEG), the average temperature for the light gray lid after 10 minut es was 45(DEG), and the average temperature for the white lid after just 10 minutes was 42(DEG). Therefore a light gray and white paint would be best to keep the doghouse cool because it heats up slower then the other colors. But if you were to use black or dark gray, it would keep the dog house warmer.
27076	10	2	2	white ::  The color of the dog house should be white because if you chooose darker colors, then the dog house will get too hot a nd your dog will be hot aswell. As the study shown, the color black had a n average of heating up to 53 degrees Celcius and had a difference of 11 degrees celcious than white color did. Same as the color black, dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the dog house dark gray because the color "Dark gray" had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white. Also in the study, the color light g ray got an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 3 degr ees celcious hotter than the color white. The best color that Brandi and Jerry should paint for their dog house would have to be the color White b ecause the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest of the colors because in the experiment they made, t he avergae degrees in celcious for White was 42 degrees celcious and if t hey paint their dog house this color, the dog house wouldnt get hot nor y our dog.
27077	10	1	1	white :: This might affect th dog house by making it c ooler in there intead of really hot all the time.
27078	10	2	2	black ::  Blacks paint color would cause the inside of the doghouse to be warmer than the rest of the colors. This is because bl ack absorbs the most amount oi\f colors over every other color. To prove this in Brandi and Jerry's experiment black kept the temperature of the j ar warmer than all the rest. It was 6(DEG)C warmer than gray, 10(DEG)C warmer than light gray, and 12 (DEG)warmer than white. This clearly show s that black would keep the doghouse warm.
27080	10	0	0	white ::  It could get dirty, you could piant it over agia,and you could draw on the walls.
27081	10	1	1	black :: The dark paint color is better because the gr eater the increase in air temprature in the doghouse ,becouse darker colo r absorbs more energy.
27083	10	0	0	black ::  cuz black is UGLY just like robert patteson
27084	10	2	2	white :: white will keep the doghouse at a lower tempe rture because in the table it averaged 42(DEG). and black averged 53.25(DEG) so to have a cooler dog house paint it white.
27085	10	2	2	white ::  While using white for the dog house the dog h ouse would be alot cooler then the other colors because the data shows th at the color white did not get as hot as the other colors did. That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house.
27086	10	2	2	black :: Black because in the eperiment black was the one that had the highest tempature so the darker the color was the higer the tepature was.
27087	10	1	1	dark gray ::  I would choose dark gray because it doesn't a ttract a ton of light. Which means the dog won't get to hot. But also bec ause it does attract some light which allows it stay warm.
27088	10	1	1	black :: the color black would affect the dog house by keeping it warmest because dark colors absorb light and turn it into heat.
27089	10	1	1	white ::  White is the best color for the doghouse because it absorbs less energy then black paint would. And then the doghouse wouldn't be too hot for the dog.
27090	10	2	2	white :: Having the doghouse painted white will affect the doghouse by making it absorb less heat causing the doghouse to be co ol inside during the summer. Because in the expirement the black lids ave rage temperature was 53(DEG) and the white lids average temperature was 42(DEG), That`s a 11(DEG) difference. So painting the doghouse white wo uld be the best decision of paint.
27091	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it won't be too hot diring the summer, also wont be to cold in the winter.
27092	10	1	1	white ::  it won't be so hot inside and it will stay co ol
27093	10	1	1	dark gray :: This will keep the dog warm but it wont get to hot or cold.
27094	10	1	1	dark gray ::  i picked dark gray because it stays the same temperature and in the data table it stayed the same temperature.
27095	10	1	1	white :: because if the dog uses it in the summer it w ill be cooler then a black dog house
27096	10	0	0	white :: its all about all the colors ha thats sick i could tipe now so how u bin good me im good to ya peace $$$$$$$
27097	10	0	0	black ::  black would be a good color because dark colo rs absorb more energy and it would be more confortable.
27098	10	0	0	dark gray :: I think it would be a good color for the dog house
27099	10	1	1	white ::  white will effect the dog house.first this wi ll effect it because white will make it cooler in the summer,because whit e doesnt absorb very much heat.
27100	10	2	2	black :: Black absorbs light. Just like with the jar l id when it was black, it absorbed the most. So if you colored the doghous e black it would increase the temperature inside it.
27101	10	2	2	black ::  They should paint the doghouse black because black will help keep the dog warm at night and during the winter when it gets cold.When they used the black lid it made it warm at an average of 5 3(DEG)C,copmared to when they used a white lid that only made it warm at an average of 42(DEG)C.Thats a difference of 11(DEG)C.
27102	10	1	1	white ::  Because light colors are the coolest in the summer time so with white being the lightest one white would work best.
27103	10	1	1	white :: it will make it be cooler in the dog house
27104	10	2	2	white :: the color white for the color of the doghouse would keep the doghouse nice and cool, as shown in the table from the sc enario when the glass jar with the white lid had an average temperature o f 42(DEG) compared to the glass jar with the black lid's average tempera ture of 53(DEG).
27105	10	1	1	light gray :: light gray cause this will give the dog house some darkness but also bright, so the dog will be able to stay cool and can sleep.
27106	10	1	1	white :: I chose white becauseit was the color that ab sorbed less heat
27107	10	1	1	black ::  if brandi and jerry painted the dog house black then the dog house would be warmer because the darker the color is the energy the dog house can absorb.
27109	10	2	2	black :: Since black is the darkest color of all the o ther colors (Dark gray, light gray, and white), because of the theory tha t darker colors absorbs more energy (heat); the inside of the doghouse wi ll be warmer as of the doghouse being painted the other colors. The proof that black would be the best paint color for the doghouse is because bla ck is the darkest of all the other colors, and darker colors absorbs more energy, also if you look at the data table for the "Lid color vs. A ir temperature inside glass jar" experiment, the average temperature for all 4 colors was black being the highest with 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray b eing 48(DEG)C, Light Gray being 45(DEG)C, and White being 42(DEG)C. Th erefore, black would be the best paint color for the doghouse.
27110	10	0	0	white ::  its obsorves less energy from the sun than al l the darker colors
27111	10	1	1	light gray :: the inside wont be too hot nor too cold
27112	10	0	0	white :: it will make the avreag tempecher go down by 11 degrees
27113	10	0	0	dark gray ::  I think dark grey would be the best one becau se it stays at the same temperture every trial . Also it would be the bes t one because it affect the dog house as much as the others because it st ays at the same constant temperture of 48(DEG)c so that color on the dog house would be realiable.
27114	10	0	0	black :: The black paint color would help make the dog house warmer during winter and insolate it better. In the experiment the black lid had the best insolation because it started at 24(DEG)C and en ded at 53(DEG)C on average. It was by far the best lid.
27115	10	0	0	black :: The color my affect the dog house because the dog might not be the same color as the house or the house will be to dar k because its black.
27116	10	1	1	black ::  Painting the dog house black (darker colors a bsorb more light) would attract more thermal energy, making the dog house nice and warm for those rainy Washington nights.
27117	10	1	1	white :: white because it doesnt absorbe light it refl ects it so thier for the in side of the dog house is not going to hot. Bu t if you use black the in side of the dog house is going to be very hot b ecause black absorbs light.
27118	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would keep it warm in the dog house
27119	10	0	0	white :: black and gray obsorb the color $
27120	10	1	1	black ::  If Brandy and Jerry pick paint their dog hous e black then the dogs will get very hot in the doghouse because black abs orbs the most energy. As a result, painting the dog house black with attr act the sun and make the dogs misserable.
27121	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be best so that it keeps the inside warm but not too hot. in the lamp expirement it was the 2nd coolest color.
27122	10	0	0	black ::  the color will affeect the doghouse because i t will be less hot iin the dog house and black reflects sunlight.
27123	10	2	2	white :: This color will make the air in the doghouse less hot, so the dog will be a lot cooler while in the doghouse. I know t his because in the experiment the air is hottest with a black lid and coo lest with a white one. So if the sun is beating down on the doghouse, it will only reach about 42(DEG) C, instead of 45(DEG) C or higher.
27124	10	1	1	white :: Color will affect the doghouse because if the house is painted black it will get very hot inside but if it is white it will say cool allowing for the dog to be comftrable in side
27125	10	2	2	white ::  The shade white will make the dog house coole r inside because the shade white does not absorb as much light energy as the shade black. I know this because in Brandi and Jerry's experiment, t he air temperature inside the jar with the black lid was an average of 53(DEG) C, and the average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. But I'd like to point out that Black and white aren't colors, they're shades. Get it rig ht.
27126	10	1	1	white :: The color white would best suit the doghouse because the color white does not attract very much heat energy so that wa y the inside of the doghouse will not be over heated.
27127	10	0	0	white :: White affects the dog house temperature becau se it has less heat obsorbing in it.
27128	10	1	1	dark gray :: the dark gray with make the house be warm not to coldnor to hot. the data shows that the dark gray is always 48(DEG)C so you dont have to worry about the temperature getting clder ar hotter.
27129	10	0	0	white :: If you paint the entire doghouse white then i t will appear to be lighter inside.
27131	10	1	1	white ::  White will cool down the dog house because it is a lighter color.
27132	10	2	2	white :: It will affect it by making it cooler than wh at the black would be if it were to be directly hit by the sun. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG)c and the white lid had an average of 42(DEG)c therefore the white lid will keed their dog cooler in the sun.
27133	10	2	2	white ::  I believe that if Bbrandi and Jerry pai n the dog house white it would stay the coldest for the dog. Evidence shows that the darker t he color the more hot it gets, for exsample the average temperature for b lack is 53(DEG), the average temperature for Dark gray is 48(DEG), the average tempertaure for light gray is 45 (DEG). The white color of lid was the lightest of them all and had the smallest temperature 42(DEG) . I sugest painting the dog house white.
27134	10	2	2	white :: The color white would affect the dog house in many good ways. one way is it wouldn't be so hot in the dog house and th e dog would enjoy being in it. The data table shows the temperature throu gh a three way trial. the average temperature is 42(DEG)c which is alot cooler and fresh then the color temperatures .
27135	10	0	0	dark gray ::  it will stay the same even after it drys. :)
27136	10	1	1	black :: it will make the inside of the doghouse warme r for the dog because dark colors obsorb more heat then light color s as shown in the investigation.
27138	10	1	1	white :: The lightest color attracts less heat.
27139	10	1	1	light gray ::  It would keep the doghouse cool but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be cold all the time
27140	10	0	0	white :: i think that the white will affect the dog ho use because the sun will shine in and melt it
27141	10	2	2	black ::  i would chooose black for my dog's house brco use during the winters the dog house would need all the heat it could get so i would choose black. black is the best color to choose becouse in th e test it was an average of 11(DEG)c hotter!
27142	10	0	0	white :: WHite dosent absorb much energy compared to b lack. black absorbs the energy like crazy
27143	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it wouldnt make it to hot in the dog house so ur dog could sleep comfurabley
27144	10	2	2	black ::  I chose the paint color black because this co lor would cause the doghouse to be warm all the time. Even on a cloudy or rainy day, Brandi and Jerry's doghouse would be warm inside because the black paint would absorb the sunlight that was still radiating from the s un. After 10 minutes of heating the glass jar with the black lid, the air 's average temperature raised 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 5 3(DEG) C. The glass jar with the white lid's average air temperature rai sed only 18(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 42(DEG) C. The differ ence between the two average temperatures for the glass jar with the blac k lid and the glass jar with the white lid was 10(DEG) C. This means tha t the darker the color on an object, the more heat energy the color absor bs, causing the air temperature within the object to be highest compared to any color lighter than it. Therefore, Brandi and Jerry should paint th eir doghouse black due to the high amount of thermal energy that the colo r absorbs.
27146	10	1	1	white :: I choise white because white would keep the d oghouse cool in the summer.
27147	10	2	2	white ::  the white had the lowest temp. in the jar so if you paint the doghouse white then it wouldnt be as warm.
27150	10	1	1	white :: white will make the dog house cooler so its m ore comferable in hot weather.
27151	10	0	0	light gray :: IT will affect it because it will absorb less heat
27152	10	1	1	white :: Barndi and Jerry should choose to paint their doghouse white because it collects less energy from the sun, causing it to be a cooler temperature which is more resonable.
27153	10	1	1	white :: White will not absorb so much heat than the o thers.
27154	10	1	1	light gray :: The color light grey is best for the dog hous e because it does not attract a lot of heat so the dog will not over heat but it wil not freeze.
27157	10	2	2	black ::  if you choose a black color for your dog hous e the tempature would be warmer than if you used a white color, because t he air inside the jar with the black lid was warmer than the lighter colo rs
27158	10	1	1	light gray :: it will keep the dog cool in the summer and w arm in the winter.
27159	10	2	2	white ::  The lighter the color, the less air temperature. The white lid color has an average of 42(DEG) C. The black lid color has an average of 53(DEG) C. The white lid color has 11(DEG) C less heat energy than the black lid color. Therefore, If Brandi and Jerry are designing a doghouse for the summer, then they should use the color white since it' ll be cooler... Vise versa, if they are going to build a house made for a colder weather, then they should use black since it absorbs more heat than any other color. The darker the color, the more heat.
27160	10	2	2	black :: This color (black) may effect the inside of t he doghouse by making the inside of the doghouse warmer. I say this becau se in the experiment with the lid colors the black lid made the inside of the jar warmer than all of the other jars. So, I'd pick the color black if you live in a cold climate, because the black color will absorb the th e light and make the dog warmer.
27161	10	1	1	white ::  white because white has the least heat drawn to it then all the other colors so your dog would be way cooler and in be tter shape in a white dog house then any others.
27162	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark gray should work just fine beacause its a little warm but not to hot and dogs like it a little warm so it would b e perfect for your dog
27163	10	1	1	white :: the color will keep the doghouse more cold in the summer.
27164	10	2	2	white ::  it wont be as hot as the other paints would l et heat in it shows that white was cooler than the others in there experi ment of lid colors heating up under a lamp
27166	10	1	1	white :: white would make the doghouse less hot on a s unny day making it a place where the dog can cool down.
27167	10	2	2	white ::  If Brandi and Jerry paint the doghouse white, than the inside of the doghouse will stay cooler than if they painted it black or gray. The average temperature for white was 42(DEG) C, while t he average temperature for black was 53(DEG) C. The difference of the tw o was 11(DEG) C, so this proves that white would be the best color to ch oose.
27168	10	2	2	white ::  It will keep the doghouse the coolest, avearg e for white was 42(DEG) C, which would keep the dog from overheating.
27169	10	2	2	white ::  If the color is white it will be more cooler than a black dog house, because black dog houses get hoter and faster, th an white dog house. If it was white it would stay around 40(DEG) instead of 44(DEG) ,48(DEG) ,and 55(DEG).
27170	10	0	0	white :: The color of the doghouse is white becuase it brings out the color of the dog if its black, brown.
27171	10	0	0	white :: That will affect the doghouse becuase that wa y there wont be to much pressure in the dog house. Then the dog wil l be comfortable
27172	10	1	1	white :: it would make it cooler on the inside
27173	10	2	2	white ::  If the doghouse is painted white then it will keep the inside of the doghouse colder. In the experiment black paint ma de the air temperature inside the jar have an average of 53(DEG)C and the white paint had an average air temperature inside the jar o f 42(DEG)C.
27174	10	1	1	dark gray :: i would go with dark gray, so that way it doe sn't attract lots of heat. But just enough heat so that way it stays warm inside, but not really warm.
27175	10	1	1	black :: I chose black, because the dog might want to stay outside anyway during the summer and lay in the shade or run through water-sprinklers; and in the winter, the doghouse would stay warm enough for the dog to sleep comfortably inside (the energy from the sun would heat the roof which would heat up the doghouse).
27176	10	1	1	dark gray ::  i choose bark gray becase it the best colore for a dog house becase its not to hot and not to cold for the dog and th e average is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and if you choosed w hit it be to cold.
27177	10	1	1	black ::  The black lid will attract more heat to the d og house.
27178	10	1	1	white :: because that color stayed the coolest on the jar
27179	10	2	2	dark gray :: The color will keep the dog house warm but not to warm. The reason I know this is because in the expi rament "Hot lamp" the dark gray lid allowed the temperature to rise an average of 48 degrees. which was warmer than the 45 and 42 degree average of the Li ght gray and white but cooler than the average of the black lid whi ch was 53(DEG)C
27180	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dark grey will make it so it isnt to hott in the dogg house or 2 cold in the dogg house.
27181	10	2	2	white :: The lighter the color, the cooler the dog wil l be. When the lid color was at it's darkest (black) the average temperat ure was 53 degrees celcius. When the lid color was at it's lightest (whit e) the average temperature was 42 degrees celcius. If Brandi and Jerry wa nt to keep their dog cool, they should use white paint.
27182	10	1	1	white :: Cause for each trail and avrage. It is the lo west tepature.
27183	10	1	1	black ::  i chose black because it was the color that kept the jar the hottest degree C(DEG).
27184	10	0	0	white ::  tha color will atract so much heat
27186	10	1	1	light gray :: The color light gray will be the best choice because on average the air tempurature stayed at an average of 45(DEG) C . So from the data you can tell that the color trys to accumilate to the weather. Also it won't be too hot or too cold for the dog to stay in.
27187	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color will make sure the inside doesn't g et too hot or too cold.
27188	10	1	1	white :: If the dog house is white then it will be coo ler in the dog house for the dog.
27189	10	0	0	black :: I will keep the dog warmer at night and durin g winter when its cold.
27190	10	1	1	white ::  It should be white so that on sunny days the dog will have a slightly colder dog house than if it was a darker color.
27191	10	0	0	dark gray ::  dark gray will effect the doghouse tempature because the air in the doghouse will stay the same all the time.
27192	10	1	1	black :: It would keep the dog house warm, because darker colors absorb more energy
27193	10	0	0	dark gray ::  beause he well feel bad and dont like it and he wont sleep.
27194	10	1	1	dark gray ::  This color is not to cold or to hot, it is ar ound normal temperature. After 10 minutes it should be around the same te mperature and if the growth in temperature continued it could get warm on cool days
27195	10	1	1	black :: the color black will affect the inside of the dog house by the out side where the sun hits will affect the in sid e by makeing it hot.
27196	10	1	1	white :: Keeps the doghouse cool and does not over hea t
27197	10	0	0	dark gray :: This color can affect the doghouse by keeping an even temperature year round, so the dog house won't get to hot or too cold for the dog. The dark gray lid kept the same temperature the entire test, giving me a conclusion that the dark gray color gives an even temp erature.
27198	10	2	2	white ::  The paint color that would be best for the doghouse is white.White is the best color to use because it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool during the day, so that way the dog inside of the doghouse doesn't get overheated. I know that white would keep the inside of the doghouse at the lowest temperature because of what the data table shows, which is that the color white's average temperature from being under the lamp for ten minutes was 42(DEG)C which was the lowest average temperature while the color black's average temperature was 53(DEG)C which was the highest temperature (which would cause the doghouse to get exteremely hot during the day, and that would be bad for the dog). So that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse.
27199	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I think that if you choose a color to dark, then it might make the dog really hot, so I would choose dark gray because it won't very hot or very cold. Dark gray has trials that are 48(DEG) C which is hot. However, it is not as hot as the color of black with the highest temperture of 54(DEG) and it's also not as cold as the color of white with the lowest temperture of 41(DEG). So Dark gray would be a good color for a dog house.
27200	10	2	2	white ::  if they were to paint the doghouse then they would want to use white becuse that is the one with the less tempa ture, average tempature was 42(DEG)c for white,unlike the black were tha t is the hottest one there is average tempature was 53(DEG)c. if they wa nt cool for the doghouse then use the white.
27201	10	0	0	black :: Black will affect the dog house becuse black fades when it's in the sun. The color will change lighter.
27202	10	0	0	white :: because the white will not atract that much h eat like the other colors.
27203	10	2	2	white :: because white does not obsorb as much heat as black, the dog house will be cooler. the white lid reached an aver age teperature of 42 dagrees c as suppose to 53 for the black one.
27205	10	1	1	black :: The darker the paint the the greater the incr ease in air tempurature in the dog house, because dark colors absorb more energy.
27206	10	0	0	light gray :: Different color affect the doghouse color aff ect the heat in the doghouse
27207	10	2	2	black ::  The black color might effect the doghouse by increasing the temperature of the house. In the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius. For the lowest color, white, it was 42 degrees celcius. This means that the black was 11 celcius warmer than the white and proves that the black colored doghouse would warm up t he house.
27209	10	1	1	white ::  If the dog house is white it will be colder i n the dog house because if the house is to hot the dog will not want to b e in it
27210	10	2	2	white :: the white will absorbe less heat and the dog house will be cooler or less hot. in the experiment black which was the d arkest had an average of 53degrees celcius and the white (the lightest co lor) had an average heat of 42 degrees celsius
27211	10	1	1	white :: the color white would reflect the suns rays a nd keep the dog house cool.
27213	10	1	1	white :: Assuming that Brandi and Jerry live in a warm climate, a white doghouse would be the better choice. This is because wh ite absorbs less heat, so a white doghouse would stay cooler and keep the dog cooler.
27214	10	1	1	black :: Black would be the best color because black e ntends to absorb heat (Thermal Energy). so the dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors wouldnt be as good because anything that is li ght as in the color white it will reflect heat/thermal energy.
27215	10	0	0	dark gray :: I picked Dark grey because it will be consistantly 48(DEG)c i know because in the table For each trial it was 48(DEG)c.
27216	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would keep the inside of the dogho use from becoming to hot, and it would still be a better color than white for cold nights. This is true because the average temperature for the bl ack lid was 53(DEG)C, the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45(DEG)C, and the average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG)C
27217	10	2	2	white :: If you were to build a dog house you wouldn't want it to get to hot, so I would choose white. The average was 42(DEG) C, since it was the coolest of the jars I think it would be best for the dog house.
27218	10	2	2	white :: The color white in the experiment showed that it had the lowest air temperature. This color would affect the inside of the doghouse by making it more cooler so that the dog wouldn't be so hot in the doghouse.
27219	10	0	0	black :: the color can effect the dog house because if the dog house is a dark color and its hot out side there will be more en ergy.
27220	10	1	1	white ::  The average temperature shows that using whit e paint for the dog house will be the best choice for keeping the dog coo l.
27221	10	1	1	white ::  White would be the coolest doghouse paint color they could choose because it takes longer to get really hot, unlike the other colors which got hot really fast.
27222	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the color will effect the dog house because i f it is black it will be hotter because it atracts more heat but if its w hite then it will atracts less heat.
27223	10	2	2	white ::  The white will keep the dog cooler in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter too. The black the dog would over heat be cause the average is 53(DEG)C, but the white is 42(DEG)C which is ok for the winter and the summer.
27224	10	1	1	black :: make it hoter
27225	10	1	1	black :: cause black is the darkest color which will m ake absorb the most heat.
27226	10	2	2	white :: White would be a good color, because on sunny days when the house is being shined on the white will make it cooler rat her then black, dark gray, or light gray. White will be cooler because in the Hot Lamp experiment they tested results for all the 4 colors above. and the average temperatrure for white was 42(DEG) C, light gray was 45(DEG) C, dark gray was 48(DEG) C, and black was 53(DEG)C. That shows that white wa s the coldest color while being shined on by light. Therefore white would be the best color to choose for the doghouse.
27228	10	1	1	white ::  white would keep the doghouse colder then any other colors and dogs hate when there hot and really cold so white is pe rfet
27229	10	2	2	black ::  brandi and jerry should paint the dog house b lack if they want the dog to stay warm, because black absorbed the most h eat at an average of 53.25
27230	10	0	0	light gray ::  it would keep the dog house at a good temp. the entire year round.
27231	10	2	2	white :: the white color will decrease the temperature in the doghouse because the average tmeperature for color black was 53 d egrees. and the average tempreature for the color white was 42 degrees. a nd thus the doghouse will be cooler
27232	10	1	1	black :: well black absorbs light soo black absorbs he at which would keep the dog warmer .
27233	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it a nuetral temperature so it doesnt get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. in the investigation light gray was the s3rd hottest so it was one of the middle colors so it would stay nuetral.
27234	10	0	0	white :: Because if you have a dog house and you paint it a white it will be a light grey inside the dog house and so from tha t the dog house will be a nice shade of white with a light coat of grey o n the inside of the doghouse and if the dog house is a square thier will be a perfect color on the d og house.
27236	10	1	1	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should use light gray so it could keep the dog cool in the summer and warm in the winter.
27237	10	2	2	white ::  if the doghouse is painted white the air temp erature will be lower than light gray, dark gray, or black. the white lid jar had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. the light gray lid had an a verage temperature of 45(DEG)C. the dark gray lid had an average tempera ture of 48(DEG)C. and the black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG) C. therefor white will help make the inside of the doghouse cooler.
27238	10	2	2	white ::  If the color is a dark color then the tempera ture will increase more than if the color is a lighter shade. White was t he color that affected the temperature the least in the experiment and th at would be the best color for the doghouse's temperature.
27239	10	1	1	white :: because white its absorbs less energy there f or cooler air tempeture
27240	10	0	0	dark gray :: it might affect the dog house a little. I cho ose dark gray because it's average.
27241	10	2	2	white :: it wil be the coolest one at 42(DEG)C and do gs have fur to keep them warm so you want a cool doghouse
27242	10	1	1	light gray :: The light gray is the best brcause it will ab sorb the heat from the sun but won't get to hot.
27243	10	0	0	white :: This color will affect the doghouse because the color white will allow more air to be in the doghouse at once.
27244	10	2	2	white ::  I chose white because from the results of the experiment, white had the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)C which means that the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog if the sun is shining on it all day.
27245	10	2	2	light gray ::  This color might affect the dog house because in the summer, when it's really hot, the light grey will not get too hot and the house is cooler and not as stuffy for the dog to sleep in versus' the black, it would be immensely humid and stuffy in there. Also, the light grey is good for the dog's wellbeing because during the winter time, the temperature will be really cold, but it would be dark enough to keep warm. So in conclusion, light grey is the best because it keeps cool in the summer and it keeps warm in the winter. Some evidence is that in the experiment, the average for the light grey was 45(DEG) C and the average for the black w as 53(DEG) C. The light gray kept cool while the black did not. So durin g the summer, the dog would die of heat stroke if they had a black house. If they had a light grey house, they would have a nice cool house to lou nge in over the summer and it is a good way to keep warm during the winte r as well! Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter .
27246	10	1	1	black :: it will make the doghouse really warm inside because the darker the color the more it absorbs energy .
27247	10	1	1	white :: white color will give back the sunlight, it m ake the doghouse will not get too much hot.
27248	10	1	1	white ::  The color white is a combination of all of th e known colors and by being that combination absorbs less heat while proj ecting the combination color that it produces.
27249	10	2	2	white ::  The color white would be a good color for a d oghouse because it heats up the air in it the least. In the experiment, t he color white only heated up the air in the jar to an average of 42(DEG) C compared to the color black which heated up the air in the jar to an average of 53(DEG)C.
27250	10	1	1	white :: It would reflect the most sunlight so the ins ide temprature would be cooler than if you were to use any of the other c olors
27251	10	1	1	white ::  This color might affect the dog house because the lighter the color the cooler the dog house will be.
27252	10	1	1	dark gray :: If they choose dark gray as the color for the doghouse, the temperature of doghouse would be neither too hot or too co ld for the dog. I chose dark gray because black would be too hot for dogs because they have furs but white would be too cold because even though t he dogs have furs, if the temperature is cold, thye will get cold. So i t hink dark gray is the best color to choose.
27253	10	0	0	white ::  White would be the best color because it refl ects the light so it would not be to hot and not to cold in the dog house .
27254	10	2	2	dark gray :: It will be warm inside the doghouse, but not too warm. The black lid made the air in the the jar very warm. I t hought it might be too hot for the dog.
27255	10	1	1	white ::  the white was the coldest and most dogs have a lot of fur so therefor the white would be best
27256	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will not be to hot or to cold
27257	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because black is the darkes t color and from the previous experiment it showed that darker colors abs orb more heat. As for white is would get the least amount of heat. Main r eason I chose dark gray was because from my expericence dogs tend to be c old, so it will be warm but not too hot.
27258	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for a dog house because it would not absorb as much energy as the other colors and there fore a white doghouse would not be as hot inside as black or gray one. Th e results from the expirement showed that the air in the jar with a black lid was 11 degrees C hotter than the jar with a white lid, and the same would apply to a doghouse.
27259	10	1	1	light gray :: Well, if you paint the dog house light gray i t will keep the dog warm at night ,But not to warm were its over heated.
27260	10	1	1	black :: becouse black color gets worm fastere then other colors and gets hit black get the tempeture 54 , the other colors get less then that
27261	10	1	1	white :: If they use the white color than the dog hous e would be cooler because brighter colors reflect the sun and in the end it would bw cooler for the dog which would make the dog happier. also the white color would look good
27262	10	2	2	black :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black. He will be warm inside the black doghouse because the average tempature of the black lid was 53(DEG)C. In the jar with the white lid, the average tempature was 42(DEG)C. It will be 11(DEG)C warmer in the black doghouse than the white one. That is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight.
27266	10	1	1	black :: make the doghouse warmer
27267	10	2	2	white ::  white would be best because it reflects more energy, the table shows that the average temp. after three trials for the white lid was 42 degrees celcius which is 11 dgrees cooler than the h ighest average(52 degrees celcius) or the black lid.
27268	10	0	0	black :: the darker color obsorbs more heat so it woul d bi a good dog house
27269	10	1	1	white ::  It would make the dog house cooler because it wouldnt attract as much heat. This is because the darker the color, the more energy it absorbs.
27270	10	2	2	white :: the white paint is the best because it wont get as hot as the other color's will beacuse the highest temp was 43 (DEG)c and the lowest was 41(DEG)c so white is the best becaue it stays the coldest
27271	10	1	1	black :: It May affect the dog house by making it warm er than the dark grey , light grey and white paint would.because the colo r black attracts heat more than any other color.
27272	10	0	0	light gray :: idk $$$
27273	10	1	1	black :: the solor energy (sun) will be attracted to the black paint, to make the inside temperature of the doghouse increase.
27274	10	2	2	white :: if ypu wanted the dog house to be cooler then i would pick a white lid because the whiit lid was an averige of 11(DEG) c cooler then the black, dark grey or light grey
27276	10	2	2	white :: I think that white would be the best color to paint the dog house because it is the color that reflects the most light so it would keep the dog nice and cool during the summer. This experiment shows that the white lid had the lesser temperature inside of the jar so it is the best color.
27277	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse because it's not too hot and it's not too cold. The average temperature would be 48(DEG) C. Just right.
27278	10	1	1	white ::  the dog house will be coller in the sun becau se the thermal heat will not get as hot as if it got painted black .
27279	10	1	1	white ::  The color white might affect the dog house be caus lighter colors reflect light.
27282	10	1	1	light gray :: The color will affect it by warming up inside the dog house but not makeing it to hot beacase 48(DEG)c is really hot so why not make it less like 45(DEG)c, and 42(DEG)c and 53(DEG)c is to cold and too hot so make it warm.....wouldn't u want a warm place to stay insted of being cold while you sleep or sweating out of no were?
27283	10	1	1	white :: It would keep the doghouse cooler.
27285	10	1	1	white :: i would pick white because with white it stay s cooler in the doghouse than if were black to be more hotter inside.
27286	10	1	1	black ::  The color will make the doghouse warmer, decr easing the need for auxiliary equipment facilitating the increased conduc tion of heat energy from the contained atmosphere between the doghouse wa lls to the dog, thus facilitating the dog's survival while maximizing cos t-efficiency. Therefore the doghouse should be black. quod erat demonstratum
27287	10	2	2	dark gray :: This color would keep the temperature just ri ght. It wouldn't be too hot or to too cold. The average (DEG)C was 48(DEG) C, the lowest average wsa 42(DEG)C and the highest average was 53(DEG)C.
27288	10	1	1	white :: Choosing white for the color of the doghouse will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler because darker colors absorb more energy.
27289	10	1	1	white ::  The darker the paint the more heat inside the room so you want the lightest colored object
27290	10	1	1	black :: It will make it so that the dog will be warme r at winter.
27291	10	2	2	light gray :: i pick light gray because after 3 trials of 24(DEG)c for 10 minutes it had an average of 45 which means that the temperature remained not to hot and not to cold.
27293	10	1	1	light gray :: I think light gray, because from the data tha t was the color that was almost in the middle, so that the dog house woul dn't get too heated in the summmer or spring, and it wouldn't get too col d in the winter or fall.
27294	10	0	0	:: do they want the dog house to be warmer or co oler: if they want to have the dog house warm all year choose black paint . if they want ithe dog house cooler all year then chose white paint. if they want the dog house to be luke-warm chose gray paint. if they wanted it to be medeum-cold chose light gray paint. not enof info to tell what you are asking for
27295	10	1	1	white ::  Black could cause the inside of the doghouse to heat up quickly because the color black heats up faster then most othe r colors.
27296	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the dog house cool on a hot s ummer day more than a darker color such as black. white was on averge 11(DEG) c cooler than black.
27297	10	1	1	black :: Since dark colors capture more heat, use black for color to help keep doghouse warm.
27298	10	2	2	light gray :: The best paint color to paint a dog house bas ed on the results is light gray. I said light gray because it was average 45(DEG)C. it is not too hot and not too cold. If you painted the dog ho use light gray it would keep the dog warm but not too warm. The black lid was average 53(DEG)C. it got hotter because the color was darker. the d ark gray was average 48(DEG)C. it was warm but not as warm as the black because the color was not as dark. the light gray was average 45(DEG)C. it got cooler because the lid color was lighter. The white lid averaged 4 2(DEG)C because it was the lightest, and dark colors absorb more heat.
27299	10	2	2	white :: White might affect the doghouse because it will not absorb as much heat as any of the other colors do. Black absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42.
27300	10	1	1	black :: The color might affect by since it is black i t will absorb more light energy which then makes the temputure higher so the inside will be warmer/hotter.
27301	10	1	1	white :: The color white will keep the doghouse cool u nder sunlight, because in the expirement, the white color reflects sunlig ht, not absorbing it. so, the doghouse will be cooler
27303	10	2	2	white :: This color might effect the doghouse because white had the lowest temperature from all the colors. In average 42(DEG) C. Also it will keep the doghouse cool in the summer so the dog doesnt get too warm in the summer.
27304	10	1	1	light gray ::  They should use light gray paint because the black would attract too much heat. The darker paint would absorb more heat like the black lid. The white paint would be too light, and in the winter wouldn't attract as much heat as needed.
27305	10	2	2	light gray ::  The color light grey will not absorb too much heat in the Summer to keep the dog cool, but will retain some heat in the winter to keep the dog warm. In the experiment, the color light grey had a temperature that was 21(DEG) higher than the starting temperature of 24(DEG), but did not increase too much like the dark grey and black which rose 24(DEG) and 30(DEG) from the original temperature of 24(DEG).
27306	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color because it had the lowest air temperature with 42(DEG)C. This would keep the inside of the doghouse air temperature cooler on hot days than a darker color would .
27307	10	1	1	light gray ::  For the bog house not to be to cold or hot.
27308	10	2	2	black ::  Black was the highest tempature when under th e lamp so if Brandi and Jerry wanted a warm doghouse they would choose bl ack because black had an avrage of 53(DEG)c insted of other averages lik e 48(DEG)c 45(DEG)c and 42(DEG)c
27309	10	1	1	white ::  i think that if you use a white paint then th e dog house will be nice a cool because if you use black the dog would ge t hot so that why you shuld use white.
27311	10	1	1	black :: black attracts more heat
27312	10	1	1	black :: The black paint will trap more heat inside. I t will be hotter in the doghouse than if Brandi and Jerry used dark grey, light grey, or white.
27313	10	2	2	dark gray :: the dark Gray Color Is fine becuz iTs Not to dark and its not too brigth. Dark Gary had A 48(DEG)c avg And The Darkes t is black which HAd a 53(DEG)c avg also the brightest which is wh ite had a 42(DEG)c avg
27314	10	1	1	black :: it would make the doghouse warm due to the da rk color.
27315	10	1	1	black :: the black paint color will attract more sun for the dog to keep warm and be comfortable
27316	10	2	2	white :: White is the best color to paint the doghouse because, based on the experiment, dark colors absord heat and light colo rs don't. The hottest air temperature in the jar experiment (53(DEG)c) w as from the jar with the black lid, and the jar with the coolest air temp erature (42(DEG)c) was from the jar with the white lid, proving that lig ht colors don't absorb heat and dark colors do.
27318	10	1	1	white ::  The color might affect the doghouse by taking in less energy causing the inside of the doghouse to be cooler.
27319	10	2	2	white ::  By painting the dog house white, it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler. This is proven because in each trial, white had the lowest temperature. For example, in the experiment, White's average tempurate was 42(DEG), compared to black's average, which was 53(DEG); a huge difference!
27320	10	2	2	white :: i chose white because white reflects the suns energy so it would stay cooler in the doghouse. the data that Brandi and Jerry got show that white kept the temperature about 11(DEG)C cooler th an the black lid
27321	10	1	1	black :: it will make it warmer for the dog inside bec ouse it absorbs more energy.
27322	10	2	2	light gray ::  I think that light gray will look nice on the outside of the dog house and it will keep the dog very nice and cool because on the data it shows that light gray was the second coolest colored lid.
27324	10	1	1	black :: i think the color black will make the isnside of the dog house warm because it is a dark color.
27325	10	2	2	white :: They might use white because it doesnt get ho t as fast as the other colors do. In the data table it shows that the fir st trail was 42(DEG) C the second trial was 43(DEG) C the third was 41(DEG) C and the fourth was 42(DEG) C. For all the other colors the trials got highe r than 43(DEG) C therefore , the white would be best for a dog house bec ause it doesnt get as hot.
27326	10	1	1	light gray :: it will make the dong house in between hot an d cold
27327	10	1	1	white :: white attracts less heat so the dog will no b e harmed on very hot days.
27329	10	0	0	black ::  It will make the inside of the dog house cold or warm .
27331	10	2	2	white :: This color would make the dog house 11(DEG)C cooler than than if it was a black color. So the dog wouldnt be hot all the time and have a cool temperature in the house. In Brandy and Jerry's experiment the white lid was the coldest, and they said dark colors absor b more heat, so white would be an appropriate color.
27332	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray might affect the doghouse by havin g the averge temperature of 45(DEG)c, so if it is cold outside it wont fre eze the dog or if it's too hot outside it wont make the dog too hot. Black had the highest aveage of 53(DEG)c, dark gray had the aveage of 48 (DEG)c,and white had the lowest average of 42(DEG)c. The light gray is just the right temperature for the doghouse of 45(DEG)c.
27333	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might bring the inside of the dogh ouse to a comfortable temperature. According to the results of the experi ment, the colors were in this order (from the highest to lowest temperatu re): black, dark gray, light gray, white. Dogs do not normally enjoy hot, stuffy enviornments. They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated, and get very uncomfortable. This light gray color will allow the dog not to get uncomfortably overheated, but will also not allow him/her to reach an uncomfortably cool body temperature- as white was resulted in the col dest temperature according to the experiment results.
27334	10	0	0	white :: i think that white is a good color because he at will not be attracted as fast and white is a really nice color.
27336	10	2	2	black :: Black will keep the inside of the doghouse the warmest because it will absorb the most heat. In the lab, black had an average of 53(DEG)C and white had an average of 42(DEG)C.
27337	10	1	1	black :: black is a darker color so there forth it att racts heat which would cause th tempatuer to go up
27338	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Well, the dark gray would make it warmer, but not to warm. &amp;they temperature would stay at one degree. So, its would be 48(DEG) in there.
27339	10	0	0	white :: it would reflect most heat because it absorb as much emergy as darker colors
27340	10	2	2	black :: Black because the black had the highest numbe r the whole expirment and it stayed the warmest out of all of the other c olor
27341	10	2	2	white :: Coloring the doghouse white will give an effe ct by not making it hot like other colors. In the experiment, they found out that the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42(DEG). The black lid was 53(DEG), the dark gray was 48(DEG), and lastly, the light gray was 45(DEG). Therefore, we can conclude that the white attracts the leas t sunlight which will affect the temperature of the inside less.
27343	10	1	1	black ::  the sun will be attracted to black and it wil l make the dog house really hot
27345	10	0	0	light gray ::  it will wear.
27346	10	2	2	white :: white because it kept the inside of the jar t he coolest so the dog wouldn't get to hot in the summer. the insidde of t he b jar with the black lid had an average of 53(DEG) c and the jar with the white lid only had an average of 42(DEG)c
27347	10	0	0	black :: the color might effect the inside because the color of the wood.
27348	10	2	2	white :: The color white will ensure that the temperature inside the dog house will stay much cooler than the colors black, dark gray and light gray, because lighter colors don't absorb as much heat energy as darker colors do. For example the inside of the jar with the black colored lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)c while the inside tempeture of a jar with a white lid had an average temperature of only 42(DEG) c. The inside of the jar with the white lid was 11(DEG)c less than the jar did with the black lid.
27349	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will be warm in the doghouse for the winte r, but not to hot for the dog in the summer.
27350	10	0	0	black :: because it atracks energy and that makes the paint to come off .
27351	10	1	1	light gray :: it wouldnt be to hot to live in(for a dog)but it would be warm and provide heat.
27352	10	1	1	white :: White, because white paint adsorbse heat less than the darker colors, and you wouldn't want your dog to over heat.
27353	10	1	1	light gray :: light gray will keep the dog house warm in th e winter because it is a dark color and it will also cool down the dog ho use because it is a light color aswel.
27355	10	2	2	black :: Having a black doghouse might affect the insi de of a doghouse because it would keep it warmer inside because darker co lors such as black absorb heat better. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment t he average temperature for the black lid jar was 53(DEG)C, 5(DEG)C more than the next warmest one, dark gray.
27356	10	2	2	black :: If they paint the dog house black the conditi ons in the house would be hot because the jar was the hottest when they p ut the black lid on the jar. So that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color.
27357	10	2	2	dark gray :: the darker the color of the doghouse the hott er it will be, so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the w inter you dont want it to be white. so i picked dark gray becasue in the winter it will still attrack sunlight to keep it warm but in the summer i t wont attract as much as the black would
27359	10	1	1	white :: White would make the dog house cooler and mor e pleastent to live in.
27360	10	2	2	dark gray :: I would choose dark gray because in the summe r it may become warm for the dog, so black would be too hot. In the winte r black would be the best because it is a color that attracts more energy so it would increase the temperature inside. So for an all around the ye ar comfortable paint I would choose dark gray because its the median betw een them both.
27361	10	0	0	white :: Ir Afeeect other people to what they may have dont to othewers and atht jksdjoiauy dhsaj 3 hfgyunashgygajshu\
27362	10	2	2	light gray ::  Dark grey would affect the temperature in the dog house by making it so that the dog house was neither too hot or too cold. The results of the experiment show that the air inside of the jar with the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42(DEG)C. In the winter if the dog house was painted white it would get to cold because the experiment shows that white does not retain heat well. Black was the color that retained the most heat in the experiment with an average tempeture of 53(DEG)C. However, even though according to the experiment,the dog house would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool. The experiment shows that the air inside of the jar with the light grey lid was warmer than the jar with the white lid, but only by 3(DEG)C, therefore the dog house should be painted dark grey because in the experiment the jar with the dark grey lid is 5(DEG)C cooler than the jar with the black lid. The dark grey would allow the doghouse to remain cool in the summer, but remain warm in the winter.
27363	10	0	0	light gray :: it will let the energy go in and out...
27364	10	0	0	black ::  because that way the dog wont be hot or cold, it would not be cold but it wont be hot eighter.
27365	10	2	2	black :: Black will absorb more heat, therefore keepin g the dog warm throughout the year. the average temperature inside the ja r with a black lid was 53 degrees Celcius, while all the other colors had an average of 48 degrees celsius or lower.
27367	10	1	1	black :: Because the darker the color the sunlight it attracks because, of the solar energy.
27368	10	2	2	black ::  The color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter. The color black absorbs heat better than the other colors. The experiment results show that black is better because in trial 1temperature was 54(DEG)c and the coldest for black was 52(DEG)c. The least warmest was the color white. The highest temperature was 43(DEG)c. the lowest was 41(DEG)c. I chose black because it will keep the dog the warmest in the cold winter. White would not be as warm as black is.
27369	10	1	1	dark gray :: By painting he dog house the color dark grey might affect the dog house by making it warmer on cold nights but not to hot like the black color will make it. I think this because on the result s chart the black is a higher temp. than the dark grey and the dark grey also always stays a consistent temp. In conclusion I think they sho uld paint the dog house grey because inside it it will niether be to hot nor to cold.
27370	10	2	2	white :: The white paint would make the inside of the doghouse coolest because according to the experiment the average of each color are black:53, dark gray:48, light gray:45, and white:42.
27372	10	2	2	white :: The Darker Colors Absorb more energy So if You Picked Black Then The Temperture would increase in the Air , for example in the experiment the Tempeture went to 54(DEG) . And for the white lid it only went up to 41(DEG) thats why painting the dog house white is better choice because it wont get so hot in the dog house.
27373	10	1	1	white ::  it will let it be less hotter.
27374	10	2	2	white ::  A white colored doghouse will make the air te mperature warmer in warm temperature, but the light color will not mak e the temperature go up a lot. With the black lid color, the temperature of the air i nside the jar was adn average of 53(DEG) after ten minutes. The white ja r was and average of 42(DEG) after ten minutes. Since both jars started at 24(DEG), the temperature of the black jar increased 29(DEG) while th e temperature of the white only increased 18(DEG). The darker the color of something, the more heat the object absorbs. That means that teh white doghouse will be the coolest doghouse, even though that doghouse will wa rm up as well.
27375	10	1	1	dark gray ::  I would say dark gray because when the sun co mes out you don't want your dog to be to warm but not to cold so dark gra y would work perfectly in my opinion.
27376	10	2	2	white :: The doghouse would have a cooler temperature than one painted in gray or black because the average temperature inside a white doghouse was 42(DEG) while the average temperatures of the black , dark gray, and light gray doghouses were 53(DEG), 48(DEG), and 45(DEG) respectively.
27377	10	1	1	black ::  IT WILLBE HOTTER COSE ITS HOT
27378	10	2	2	white :: white had the lowest temperature so the dogho use wont get extremely hot.
27379	10	1	1	light gray ::  it might be less hot than a darker lid becaus e black absorbes the most heat.
27380	10	1	1	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse white. This is because in the summer, when the temperature outside gets h otter, the inside of the doghouse will be cooler for the dog. That is bec ause darker colors absorb more light ad heat energy.
27381	10	0	0	dark gray ::  The dark gray color might affect the doghouse by keeping the doghouse the same temperature throughout the year which i s not too cool but not too hot (48(DEG)). I know this because on the dat a table it shows that throughout all the trials the dark gray was the col or that kept the temperature inside the jar stay the same.
27382	10	2	2	white :: The white paint would be the best choice for a color of a dog house because after 10 minutes of having a white lid, th e air temperature inside the jar was the lowest. It seemed that the light er the color, the lower average temperature the air inside the jar was af ter 10 minutes. This would be the best color for a dog house because if y ou would like to keep your dog cooler in the summertime, having a white p ainted dog house would stay much cooler on the inside that if there was a black paint instead.
27383	10	2	2	white ::  Painting the doghouse white will raise the temperature only slightly, while painting the doghouse a darker color wil l raise the temperature significantly. In the Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar data table, the temperature inside the jar with the white lid, raised an average of 18(DEG) C from the starting tem perature after 10 minutes. The temperature inside the jar with the black colored lid raised an average of 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature after 10 minutes. If Brandi and Jerry wanted the temperature in the doghouse to be cool, then they would paint the doghouse white. If they wa nted the temperature to be warm, they would paint the doghouse black. I w ould paint the doghouse white.
27384	10	0	0	black :: more dogs like black
27385	10	1	1	white ::  If they were to use white the dog house would be cooler for the dog to sleep in or just hang out and cause less " damages" or issues to the dog
27386	10	1	1	light gray ::  the light gray so its not to hot and not to c old
27387	10	1	1	light gray ::  I would choose Dark gray because on a hot day, the dog can stay nice and cool, and on a cold day the color is still a ble to absorb some heat. The experiment proved that darker colors absorb more heat than lighter so the dark gray color would be the best. Also in the trials, The average temp of the jar is 48(DEG)c so the dog would be nice and warm in the house.
27388	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by being cooler inside than the darker colors because white obsordes less he at than dark colors. Thats why in Brandi and Jerry's lid experiment white lid was the coolest of the darker colors.
27389	10	2	2	white :: I choose white because white is the lightest color and it absorb the least heat so inside the dog house will be more c ooler. I know this because in the investigation it said white had 42(DEG) C which is the lowest while the black had 54(DEG)C which is the highest.
27390	10	2	2	white :: the lighter color would help keep the doghous e cooler inside. for example, the jar with the white colored lid was cool er; 42(DEG) than the black lid; 53(DEG)
27391	10	0	0	light gray :: Because it made a mild temperature in the jar
27392	10	1	1	white :: How this color might affect the doghouse is w hen a color is lighter like the color white, that color doesn't absorb al ot of heat like the color black. So when it's going to be really hot outs ide, inside the doghouse it will be cool.
27393	10	1	1	light gray :: this would absorb more thermal energy while still keeping cool because of the lightns of the gray.
27394	10	1	1	black :: black will affect the doghouse because it wil make the inside hot.
27395	10	1	1	light gray :: The light gray would keep the dog house at a more even temp because its both a light and dark color so it would atrackt the right amount of sun light and repel just the right amou nt of sun light.
27396	10	0	0	white :: the doghouse should be white because it has the warmest or cooldest temperture on the average from the table. it will be warmer or colder than the other colors so the dog living in the doghouse wont be hot or cold.
27397	10	1	1	dark gray :: The color will affect the dighouse by not mak ing it to cold and not making it to warm.
27398	10	1	1	white ::  i would make the dog house white because whit e dose not actracte alot of heat so the dog would not be so hot.&#916;
27399	10	1	1	light gray ::  LIght grey would be a great color to use on a dog house because, the color would not obsorb a lot of heat and and it w ould not be to cold because grey is still a dark color that could obsorb heat, when needed.
27400	10	2	2	white ::  White paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the 10 mins. under the light it was the coldest with an average of 42o, 11 degrees colder than the hottest pai nt color of black the average of the black paint's air was 53.
27401	10	1	1	white ::  the inside wont be as hott.
27403	10	0	0	dark gray :: dark grey because if you use this color the d og house will be about 48 degrees and the dog house will not be to cold
27404	10	2	2	dark gray :: The color, dark gray, would affect the doghou se because it would stay at a pretty warm temperature. This way, the dogh ouse would be around 48(DEG). The doghouse would not be too hot (53(DEG) ), as it would be with the color black, but the doghouse would not be too cold (42(DEG)), as it would be with the color white.
27405	10	0	0	light gray :: Because the dogs liked their home and the dog feels comfortable.
27408	10	1	1	white :: because it obsorb less heat and energy
27409	10	2	2	white ::  It wil make it so the air inside of the dogho use will be cooler so the dog dosnt get to hot. I knowjthis because the d ata shows the averge temperature for white was 42(DEG)c.
27410	10	1	1	white ::  Less heat in the dog house so there would be much more comfort for the dog.
27411	10	2	2	black :: this color would make the doghouse warmer bec ause in the experiment the darker the color, the warmer it will be inside .
27412	10	1	1	white :: White is best in this situation, as long as i ts not cold out. white reflects heat, thus the Husky or Lab or what ever dog or wolf it is, stays cool and collect.
27413	10	1	1	light gray :: The color absorbs enough heat not to be cold in the winter, but not to much heat to be hot in the summer.
27414	10	1	1	dark gray :: It will take in heat in the winter and won't take as much in in the summer as black would.
27415	10	1	1	white :: white absorbs less heat so it would keep the dog cooler
27416	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray is the best color for the dog hous e because it doesn't make the dog house too hot but it also doesn't make the dog house too cold. The black had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C which is too hot for a dog in the summer. it needs to be at a rela xing temperature which is 45(DEG)C for the light gray. If i were to choo se the white it would be too cold for the poor dog to be in. The light gr ay color would make it so that the dog could be very confortable in his l ittle house.
27417	10	2	2	black ::  The black paint because it will absorb more light energy causing the inside of the dog house to be warmer, keeping the dog warm at night. The average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG), while the white was 42(DEG). The black paint had the highest temperature out of all colors and was 11(DEG) higher than the white paint.
27418	10	0	0	white :: The black color, when it gets dark dogs will have a dark doghouse so i just picked white.
27419	10	2	2	black ::  Clack absorbs more heat energy, so it would m ake the doghouse a warmer place for the dog. The average temperature for the black lid was on average about 8(DEG) C more than the other colored lids. That is why black would be a good choice to paint the doghouse with .
27420	10	0	0	white :: porque es el que da mas inside de glass
27421	10	2	2	black :: If the color of the doghouse was black then i t would make the inside of the doghouse warmer inside. In the experiment it was 53(DEG)C on average in the jar when the lid was black and only 42 (DEG)C on average when the lid of the jar was white.
27422	10	1	1	black :: i think they should use blak beacause it woul d be warmer for the dog.
27423	10	0	0	white :: The darker colors will absorb heat faster tha n lighter colors.
27424	10	0	0	black :: Black, because on a warm day the dog house would heat up but it wouldnt be too hot for the dog. And on a cold day the dog house should be the same tempature ( 53(DEG) C ) or get a little col der, but not to cold for the animal.
27425	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose the dark gray paint color because it would keep the dog warmer in the winter than the white or light gray pain t, but cooler in the summer than the black paint would. The experiment su pports this because the dark grey paint in the experiment made the inside temperature an average of 48(DEG)C, while the highest average data, the black paint, was a temperature of 53(DEG)C, too hot, and the lowest av erage data, the white paint, was 42(DEG)C, too cold for the dog.
27427	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best paint color for a doghouse. Light gray had an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldn't b e too cold or too warm for a dog. A white doghouse was 42 degrees which m ight make the dog cold and black and dark gray would make the dog too war m. Dark grays average was 48 and blacks average was 53, much too warm.The refore light gray would be the best color.
27428	10	0	0	white ::  If the insid eof the dog house is white then the dog house wont be so hot because of the shade
27430	10	2	2	white :: I would pick white paint to paint the dog hou se because according to the experiment white was the color that the insid e of the jar would be less hot. Accordig to Brandi and Jerry's data the w hite lid had a temperature 42(DEG)C inside the jar and the black lid was 53(DEG)C and i dont want my dog to be to hot or sufficate in the dog ho use.
27431	10	1	1	light gray :: I would chose light gray because in the summe r, a black house might over-heat the dog, however in the winter a white h ouse might be too cool. A light gray house would repel heat in the summer , and allow more heat in the winter.
27433	10	1	1	light gray :: the color would keep the doghouse at a perfec t temperature not to hot or not to cold
27434	10	1	1	black :: Black would be a good color for the dog house because in the day it would get hotter because black absorbs heat causin g it to be warmer in their at night.
27435	10	2	2	black :: We can see from this expirement that darker colors absorb more heat. Knowing this information, for the dog to be more warm and comfortable inside his doghouse, Brandi and Jerry should paint the house Black.
27436	10	2	2	white :: Assuming that the location of the doghouse ha s a warm climate, the white paint color will be more likely to keep the t emperature of the air inside the doghouse at a cooler, or lower, temperat ure. This can be said because the white paint color, on average, made the air inside the glass jar a temperature of 42(DEG) C, compared to 53(DEG) C for black paint, 48(DEG) C for dark gray paint, and 45(DEG) C for light gr ay paint. It is vital that the doghouse maintains a low temperature so th at the dog, that stays inside the doghouse, doesn't overheat.
27437	10	2	2	white ::  They should use white paint because when the sun comes out the doghouse won't get as much heat absorbed. As shown in t he table the darker lid they used the hotter the air became and white is the lightest color used and it had the lowest temperature.
27438	10	2	2	dark gray ::  The color will effect the dog house by keepin g it the same temperature which would be cool in the summer and warm in t he winter because the trials show that the dark grey paint made the jar t he same temperature for all 3 trials; which the average temperature was 48(DEG)C.
27439	10	2	2	dark gray :: I think the best color for the dog house is D rrk gray, because it's not the hotest color or the coldest which will hel p the dog stay cool but also warm. It showed that in each trial the tempe rture was 48(DEG)C for the dark gray color which mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time. Also Dark gray takes in more heat then white by 6(DEG)C average.
27440	10	2	2	white :: it will keep it cooler due to the fact that w hite dosnt abosorb as much heat as dark gray, light gray and black. also, because blacks average (in (DEG)c) was 53 dark grays average was 48. li ght grays average was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42. leaving that white wi ll leave the dog house cooler.
27441	10	1	1	black :: black would be the best because it keeps the inside of the dog house the warmest and would keep the dog warm and not cold
27442	10	2	2	black ::  Black would be an ideal color to pain the dog house because of the insulation if provides within. Out of all the colors of white, dark gray, light gray, black and white, black had the highest temperature within the glass jar with and average of 53(DEG)C while the lowest temperature was with the color of white with an average of 42(DEG) C. Thus choosing black should make the doghouse warmer because black seemed to have a high temperature than any other. However, you must also consider w here the doghouse is being placed. If the doghouse should be placed outdo ors, black would be the ideal color to keep the dog warm during cold wint ers. If placed indoors, the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm.
27444	10	0	0	black :: 1:The dog will be feeling like fanetting. 2:The dog will gett thirsty. 3:The dog will breath reeally hard.
27445	10	0	0	white ::  The color should keep the inside of the dog house at a reasonable temperature. Based on the results from the experiment, the hypothesis was right about black soaking up heat through the black rather than white. So the white paint would work the same by keeping the heat under control and not letting it all in.
27446	10	0	0	dark gray :: because dark gray color absorb more energy.
27447	10	2	2	white :: This color effects the dog house because it m akes it cooler according to the Hot lamp experiment.In there experiment t he white lid was the coolest.
27448	10	2	2	white :: The best color to paint the top of the doghou se would be white. In the experiment, on average the black lid absorbed 5 3(DEG)C, dark gray:48(DEG)C, light gray:45(DEG)C, white:42(DEG)C . The black lid absorbed 11(DEG) more heat than the white lid. By painti ng the top of the doghouse white, it decreases the amount of heat getting traped within the doghouse.
27449	10	0	0	white ::  how white would affect the doghouse is that i t would get drityer more easly thats how it would affect the doghouse.
27450	10	2	2	light gray ::  In there experiment they found out that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use a light grey for the dog house because it doesnt absorb a lot of heat and it will stay nice and cool inside but it will let absorb some heat but it will be just the right tempature.
27451	10	1	1	dark gray :: black because it will get to hot
27452	10	1	1	light gray :: light gray because it wont make the inside of the dog house to hot because the dog already has a large coat of fur and dark gray wont over heat the dog house.
27453	10	1	1	white :: the lighter the color, the less heat will be inside the dog house. the darker the color, more heat will be inside the dog house
27454	10	1	1	white ::  so that the dog can be fresh not hot over the summer and its not too cold for the winter.
27456	10	1	1	white :: I would choose white because i would want my dog to not have all that heat trapped up in a little tiny space. That hot air which is absorbed through dark colors i wouldn't want my dog sitting in that. I would want him to be cool so thats why i choose the white col or as a paint for a doghouse.
27457	10	2	2	white :: Based on the data, white had the lowest tempe rature average of 42, while others have an average of 45, 48, and 53. It all depends on the dog you are getting, if its fur is dark, better to ge t light colors so it can be cooler.
27458	10	1	1	black :: this color would keep the inside of the dogs house warm because dark colors attract heat from the son.
27459	10	1	1	white :: The color white does not absorb as much heat as a darker color and the doghouse wont get as hot.
27460	10	1	1	light gray :: it can keep it cool in the summer and warm in the winter
27462	10	0	0	black :: they sould use black because black keeps heat better than the other colors so the dont want there dog to get cold so b lack is the most affective color.
27463	10	1	1	dark gray :: The temperature will stay the same in the col d and hot weather. The temperature will never be too hot or too cold.
27464	10	2	2	white ::  White would affect the doghouse because accor ding to the results of the experiment, Trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54(DEG), dark gray made it 48(DEG), light gray made it 44(DEG), and white made it 42(DEG). They should choose white be cause it would keep the doghouse the coolest, that way the dog doesn't ov erheat.
27465	10	2	2	white :: The white lid had the lowest temperature and the black lid had the highest temperature so they would use white so when the temperature outside is hot the inside of the dog house wont get hot because the white paint will deflect the heat.
27466	10	2	2	white :: White, because the data showed the tempatures of each of the lids, and from the data table it shows that black (53degr ees) was the highest, and white(42degrees) was the lowest. So if they wan t a to paint the dog house, they should paint it white, do to , the tempa ture of the dog house wont be to hot for the dog to be in.
27468	10	0	0	white :: I choose white because if the doghouse is out side, then the white would absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm with out overheating it.
27469	10	2	2	black :: the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy. black is the warmest in the investigation for the lamp and colo r of the lid it got an average of 53(DEG) C. the lightest color (white) got an average of 42(DEG) C.
27470	10	1	1	dark gray :: A dark gray color would absorb more heat then light gray and white making it warmer but not as much as black so it won t get too warm.
27472	10	1	1	white :: With white the temperaturein the dog house wo uld stay nice andd cool in the summer
27473	10	2	2	white :: the color white would affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler than any other of the colors. i know this because in th e experiment, the white colored lid had a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid had a change of temperature of 29.
27475	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house was white the inside would b e cooler because in the data of the experiment the average temperature of white is 42(DEG)c and blacks average is 53(DEG)c
27476	10	2	2	white ::  that color will keep it cooler and not as hot in the summer time. i know this because in the experiment the black lid had an average of 53 and white had an average of 42, so thats more than a 10(DEG)c difference.
27477	10	1	1	light gray :: Light Gray because its not hot or cold but a little warmer than white.
27478	10	1	1	black :: it will keep the dog house warmer because the black attracks heat
27479	10	1	1	black ::  The color black because it would be warm in t he doghouse. Since black absorbs more heat black would be best to keep th e dog warm rather than cold.
27481	10	2	2	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry used the color dark gray for their doghouse that would be the best color because it would keep the doghouse warm and cool depending on the seasons. The color dark gray in the jar experiment had an average of 48(DEG)C. That makes the temp erature of the doghouse in general, not to hot and not to cool based on t he jar experiment.
27482	10	2	2	white :: white will make the doghouse cooler than a da rker color such as black because in the data table it shows that the aver age temperature inside the jar with a white lid was 42(DEG)C and inside the black lid it was 53(DEG)C, that is 11(DEG)C warmer.
27483	10	2	2	black :: If he choses black the doghouse will get more hot air because in the story the black color gets more heat because its darker
27484	10	2	2	white :: It would make it cooler in there for the dog, because white and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then dark er colors. For example, the average for the black lid was 53(DEG)C, but the average for the white lid was only 42(DEG)C. Which is a lot less. So I think Brandi and Jerry should go with painting their doghouse white.
27485	10	2	2	white :: A white dog house will absorb heat the worst so it will be cooler inside. I know this because in the experiment the bl ack lid got to be the hottest at 54(DEG)C well white was the coolest at 42(DEG)C. White was also cooler then dark gray at 48(DEG)C and light gr ay at 44(DEG)C. So white would be the coolest for the doghouse.
27486	10	1	1	black ::  The dog house if painted black will be warmer because the color black atracts heat.
27487	10	0	0	light gray :: The light grey will effect the doghouse by ma king it more noticable and plus dogs can only see black, white and grey.
27488	10	1	1	light gray :: it can make it hot but not to hot cause it do nst atract as much heat as black or dark gray
27489	10	1	1	black ::  the darker the color the more heat it absorbs . Haveing a black dog house would make it warm on the inside
27490	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry predicted that the darker th e lid color, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar , becuase darker colors absorb more energy. Their hypothesis was correct. This is because the average temperature inside the glass jar with the bl ack lid after three ten-minute trials was 53 degrees but the average temp erature inside the glass jar with the white lid after three ten-minute tr ials was 42 degrees. Because black was the darkest color of the lid, it a bosrbed the most heat so the air temperature was highest (and vice versa for the white lid.) Thus, because we don't want the doghouse to be overhe ated, the best color to paint it would be white because white would absor b the least heat.
27491	10	2	2	black :: The color black will affect the doghouse by m aking it a warmer environment for the dog. Plus if it is a cold winter, t he doghouse will help to keep the dog warmer. The data table shows that u sing the black lid color the air temperature was clearly around 12(DEG) higher then the white lid, about 10(DEG) higher in temperature than the light gray lid, and about 6(DEG) higher in temperature than the dark gray lid each trial. The average temperature was 53(DEG)C for the black lid, the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the average tem perature for the light gray lid was 45(DEG)C, and the average temperatur e for the white lid was 42(DEG)C. It shows the black lid absorbs more he at to keep the doghouse warmer.
27492	10	0	0	black :: is to dark
27493	10	1	1	white ::  White would be the best color for a dog house because according to this expiriment whit absorbs the most heat with an average temperature of 42(DEG)C compared to the black paint which had an average tempurature of 53.25(DEG)C, making the dog house a cooler place to live.
27494	10	1	1	black :: if the doghouse is black than the inside will be warmer when there is sun shining on it, so the dog will stay warm
27495	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray would allow the dog house to absorb heat, though not as much as black, so it would not be incredibly h ot, but it would still be warmer than white. Also, it wouldnt be as cold as the white, but would be cooler than the black. So light grey is the perfect color to be not quite hot and not quit e cold, and just the right temperature to make the dog house comfortable for the dog.
27497	10	2	2	white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be white. Inside of the doghouse, the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were painted black or gray. The average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG) C, but for the white lid, it was 42(DEG)C. The white lid made the air 11(DEG) cooler than the black lid.
27498	10	0	0	white :: white cause black makes heat worse and so i c hose white because every dog house is white because its easier to see in the dark and its comfy and warm.
27499	10	1	1	black ::  the darker the color the greater the increase in the air temperature in the dog house because darker colors absorb mor e energy.
27500	10	1	1	white :: white will ceep the doghouse cooler
27501	10	0	0	black :: black will affect the dog house buy keeping h eat in
27502	10	0	0	black ::  brings heat in the dog house
27503	10	1	1	white :: White doesn't attract heat but black, dark gray and light gray do, so the dog would be kept cool.
27504	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would keep the temperature of the doghouse constant and it wouldnt be too hot or to cold.
27505	10	0	0	dark gray ::  dark gray will keep the dog house the same te mp in the summer and winter as long as therer is light.
27506	10	1	1	white ::  white is the best becouse it is the coolest and would not over heat he dog
27508	10	1	1	light gray :: If the doghouse is light gray then in the win ter it will be slightly warmer than the actual temperature and in the sum mer it will be slightly cooler than the actual temperature.
27509	10	1	1	light gray :: based off the results, you would want this co lor because it doesn't attract to much heat , and it wouldn't be to cold at the same time.
27510	10	1	1	light gray :: I think light gray would be the best because it wouldn't be too hot or cold
27511	10	2	2	white :: the white dog house will not make the dog as hot inside because white is a very bright color, but black is a dark colo r so it will get hotter. In the xperiment when the black cap was on the t emperture was hotter than having the white cap on.
27512	10	2	2	light gray :: I choose light gray because light gray isnt t oo light and is not too dark. Light gray will cause the dog house to be a t a comfortable temperature. If it was white, it would be too cold and if it was black, then it would be too hot. In the experiment, light gray ha d an average temperature of 45(DEG)C while white had 42(DEG)C and black had 53(DEG)C.
27514	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best color for a dog house because it absorbs the least amount of heat. In Summer, you wouldn't wan t the dog house to be over-heated. The white color had an average of 42(DEG) C while the black color was 53(DEG)C, this is a difference of 11(DEG)C between the two colors.
27515	10	1	1	black ::  The color black would make the house warmer o n the inside.
27516	10	2	2	white :: I think that white would be a good color, bec ause in Brandi and Jerry's expeirement, white gave a cooler temperature t han the others, so the doghouse could be colder than warmer.
27517	10	1	1	dark gray :: this color would allow the house to collect s ome heat without it being to hot. Since gray is lighter then black but no t to light.
27518	10	2	2	light gray ::  This color would affect the doghouse by being dark enough to let heat in during cold seasons and being light enou gh to keep heat out during the summer and on other hot days. On average, the heat inside the jar with a light gray (45(DEG)C) was cooler than tha t of Black (53(DEG)C) and dark gray (48(DEG)C)
27519	10	1	1	white :: so if it is hot out side and the dog wants to go in side the dog house then it will be cooler because the color of the dog house is white.
27520	10	1	1	light gray ::  It depends on the dog. If the dog has medium amount of hair then the best color would probably be light gray because i t doesnt obsorb that much heat energy. But if the dog was a hairless one then it would be best to go with black so that way the dog could get enou gh heat in the doghouse.
27521	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark grey will make the dog house warm inside but it wont get to hot for the dog. in the jar the air tempature insde t he jar with the dark grey lid stayed at 48. there for in the dog house it wont be to cold or to hot it will be warm
27522	10	2	2	white ::  White could be a color for the doghouse. It wouldn't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is. Also, in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors. 42(DEG) C, 43(DEG) C, 41(DEG) C, and 42(DEG) C. Where as the other colors, black, dark gray, and light gray, all had higher temperatures. The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54(DEG) C, the color black. To the lowest te mperature, 41(DEG) C for the color white.
27524	10	1	1	black :: The darker the color is the hotter the doghou se would be. The lighter the doghouse is the cooler the doghouse would be inside
27525	10	0	0	white :: it will keep the temp. in the 40(DEG) area ( C(DEG)) and not burn up the dog inside the dog-house.
27526	10	2	2	white ::  The color white might affect the doghouse bec ause the dog won't get too hot in the summer because the weather is warme r in the summer and white is the coolest color out of the four. White was only 42 degrees and black was 53 degrees.
27527	10	2	2	light gray :: Choosing the light gray for the color of the doghouse would be a good color. It wouldn't be to hot or to cold for the dog. During the experiment the black lid produced a very hot temerature o f 53(DEG)C. The white lid created a temperature of 42(DEG)C. Choosing the light gray color would be a good medium.
27528	10	2	2	white :: White might affect the inside of the dog hous e because, it went up only 20 degrees from the starting temperature. I th ink white is the best paint color to use because, it had the lowest tempe ratures and it doesnt absorb alot of energy.
27529	10	2	2	white ::  white would make the dog house less hot. the data table shows that the white paint kept the jar cooler than the other paint in trial 1,2, and 3.
27530	10	0	0	white :: becuse dog can ony see black and white so that will affect the dog house
27531	10	2	2	white ::  The color white wouldn't absorb as much ener gy as the darker colors so the doghouse wouldn't become too warm. With a black lid, the jar was an average temperture was 53(DEG) C after 10 minu tes. With the White lid the temperature was an average of 42(DEG) C. Thi s shows that the lighter the color, the less heat you will have trampted inside the dog house. Something to warm would not be suitable for a dog, and therefore making white the right color.
27532	10	0	0	light gray :: light gray how it might affect the doghouse i s that the lighting could be so powerful from the light that the color mi ght get really hot well the dog house might get really hot.
27534	10	2	2	white :: A white color would keep it cooler because, a ccording to the data, white has the lowest average temperature of 42 degr ees celcius, while black has the highest average temperature of 53 degree s celcius.
27535	10	1	1	light gray ::  Based on the data I think light grey would be the best color. I think that because it would make the doghouse warm fo r the winter but it wont be too hot in the summer.
27536	10	1	1	light gray :: A light gray would make the dog house warm bu t not too cold like when it is raining you don't want to have a white dog house. The average for the black colored lid was 53(DEG)C which is too hot and the dark gray was 48(DEG)C which is still a little too hot and t he average for the light gray is 45(DEG)C and the white was 42(DEG)C so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends o n the dog so if you had a shaved or close to shaved dog you would maybe e ven want a dark gray dog house but if you had a dog with a lot of hair yo u would want a white dog house.
27537	10	1	1	white :: The white color would absorb the least amount of heat in the doghouse, meaning it would be great for summer. But if yo u want the warmer house in the winter, the black doghouse should do the t rick.
27538	10	0	0	black ::  Really black.
27540	10	1	1	white ::  This color might affect the doghouse because since white doesn't absorb any heat the dog house inside will be cool eno ugh for the dog to be in. Darker color absorbs more energy and since whit e is the lightest color of all the colors there will be no energy absorbe d.
27543	10	2	2	black :: the more dark the dog house iis the hoter it will be in the dog house so if it was black it would be hot in it like in the experiment when the kid was black it was 53 dagrees c and when the l id was white it was 42 dagrees
27544	10	2	2	white ::  The color of the doghouse should be white because that way in the summer it won't be to hot for the dog. As shown in the data white is the coolest. The average for a black lid is 53(DEG) C. The dark gray lid is 48(DEG) C the light gray lid is 45(DEG) C and the white lid is 42(DEG) C. Therefore the white is the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog.
27545	10	1	1	white :: With a white doghouse the dog will be cool when the weather is warm/ hot because the white paint will not absorb as much heat and in the winter it will not matter because there is not much heat to absorb anyway so it would not matter how dark the paint is.
27546	10	1	1	black ::  The color black whould be the best color to paint the dog house because, you will have a higher temperature with a darker color it will have a warmer. There will be a higher chance for the doghouse to be at a higher temperature.
27547	10	1	1	black ::  it will keep it hot because black absorbes the suns rays faster then a lighter coller
27548	10	1	1	white ::  The air temperature will be lower on average, because in the experiment white kept the temperature inside the jar the l owest.
27549	10	1	1	light gray ::  this color will affect the doghouse by heatin it, but not overheating the doghouse.
27550	10	1	1	white :: white because white reflects sun and u want i t to be cold in a dog house for a dog
27551	10	2	2	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color because it wo uldn't be too cold nor to hot. in the experiment the dark gray jar was in the middle of tempertures not being the coldest like the white or the wa rmest like black but somewhat in the middle with an average temp of 48(DEG) c
27552	10	1	1	white :: The dog house would stay cooler because white doesn't attract the that much heat.
27553	10	2	2	white :: The color white had the lowist temp at the en d of the expairement so that means it will be cooler inside the dog house then it would be with other colors
27554	10	1	1	dark gray :: It wold make it cooler in the sumer but warme r in the winter because the dark coler would atraket the heat.
27555	10	2	2	white ::  White would be better for the doghouse becaus e it doesnt absorb that much energy like black and dark gray did. white o nly absorbed an average of 42(DEG) c, where black absorbed an average of 53(DEG) c.
27556	10	2	2	dark gray :: Dark Gray would be the best color for the dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold. Darker colors attract more heat than Light so Dark Gray wouldn't be too hot or cold. In an Air temperatur e expirement, four colors were measured; Black, Dark Gray, Light Gray, an d White. The Data measured Black as 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray as 48(DEG)C, Li ght Gray 45(DEG), and White 42(DEG)C. Dark Gray as you see isn't too wa rm, neither too cold, making it the best color for the doghouse.
27557	10	2	2	white ::  Using white paint would make the doghouse col der than if they used black paint. As was shown by the table, the average temperature of the jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C, while the average temperature of the jar with a white lid was 42(DEG)C. The jar with the black lid was 11(DEG)C warmer than the jar with the white lid. Thus, usi ng white paint would also make the doghouse colder than using black paint , and Brandi and Jerry should use white paint.
27558	10	1	1	white :: white will make the dog house cooler because it reflects the most light
27559	10	2	2	white ::  The black was 9(DEG) C warmer then the white colored paint. The black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog. The white paint would be better bacause it would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer.
27560	10	2	2	white :: painting the dog house white will keep the inside cooler then the black paint job by 11(DEG)C. the average temperature for the black lid jar air was 53(DEG)C where as the average temperature for the white lid jar air was an average of 42(DEG)C.
27563	10	0	0	white ::  bright colers reflect the light so the dog wi ll not get so hot.
27564	10	1	1	black ::  the color black would keep the the dog warm.
27565	10	1	1	light gray :: the color wouyld affect the dog house in this way in the heat the dog would stay cool but its not so light that it wou ld be cold for him in the winter. so keeping it at a light darker color y ou ahve a mixeture of the 2.
27566	10	2	2	light gray ::  A light gray paint on the doghouse might prov ide some heat in the winter, while not making it too hot in the summer. T hat is shown by the data, in the 20(DEG) C increase in temp. Dark g ray or black would overheat the doghouse during the summer, because of th e average increases of 24(DEG)C for dark gray and 29(DEG)C fo r black. A white paint would not provide much heat during the winter, sho wn by the meager 18(DEG)C increase. However, on the other hand this experiment is n't closley applicable. the doghouse would not likely be made of glass, a nd sealed off from outside air curculation. Also, the sun burns many diff erent gases, providing a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp, in addit ion to being brighter. The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof , made of wood and shingles. - a note: You could have interchangable roofs on the do ghouse, one of each color, and circulate them during the year, with white in the summer and black in the winter, and the other two scattered betwe en.
27567	10	1	1	white :: i think it would be white because then when i t is hot out side then it would wouldnt be as hot in the dog house then i t would be when the dog house is white.
27568	10	2	2	light gray ::  it will affect the dog house by keeping it so me what cool in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an a verage of 45(DEG)Celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average 5 3(DEG)Celsius making an 8(DEG)Celsius difference between the two.
27569	10	2	2	black ::  The color black will be more warmer inside than any other colors above thus, Brandi and Jerry should paint th dog ho use black. According to the results from the experiment, the color black had the highest average air temperature of 53. The darker the color the warmer the air temperature was in the glass jar because darker colors absorb more energy.
27570	10	2	2	black :: The black paint might make the dog house abso rb more heat, making the dog house warmer. I think this is how the paint will affect the dog house becuase in the experement results, the black pa int retained the most heat in the glass jar.
27571	10	0	0	white ::  because white dose not atract anything
27572	10	1	1	white :: white would be better because during the summ er it would be cool with a white dog house and it would be hot and humid with a black dog house
27573	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will warm the dog house but not get it to warm
27575	10	1	1	light gray ::  In all seasons the doghouse will stay at a comfortable temperature. In the warmer weather the color won't absorb as much heat keeping the doghouse cool. During the colder seasons, the dog will still have a warmer area, and with the dogs fur he would stay nice and warm.
27576	10	2	2	white :: The white paint color would be cooler becaus e on a sunny hot day the dog might be really hot, so the dog would just g o in his dog house. The white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat. Ther efor the inside of the dog house would be allot cooler than being in the sun. The experiment tells it all, the white after only 10 minutes got up to 40(DEG)c as the other colors went up to 45, 48, and 53. The dog would much appreciate a cooler place to rest. Coming to a solution the white p aint would be the best to use for a dog house.
27577	10	2	2	black :: White would keep the doghouse the coldest (ar ound 40). If the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties. If th e doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties. If the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties. If the doghouse was black it wou ld be in the low fifties. White would reflect the light and not heat up t he doghouse as much as any other color.
27578	10	0	0	white :: it does not atract as much lite as a darker c olor
27579	10	1	1	black :: because black absorbs heat more then the othe r colors
27580	10	1	1	white :: The color white absorbs less heat therefore w ill reduce the impact the sun has on the temperature inside the doghouse.
27581	10	1	1	black :: The color black prevents more cold and absorb s more thermal energy, making it a warmer place for the dog.
27583	10	2	2	light gray ::  Painting the doghouse light gray would keep t he doghouse cool in the summer but warmer in the winter. I know this beca use the data tells you that the lighter the color of the glass jar, the c ooler the inside of the jar is and the darker the lid is the higher the t emparature while be in the glass jar
27584	10	1	1	white :: white becuase if you live in a hot place the dog house will be less hot because white reflect most of the light off of the dog house.
27585	10	1	1	light gray :: This color will affect the doghouse for the b est. The darker color keeps in heat but sometimes heat isn't always good. I found a compromise that can keep heat in and has a somewhat high air t emperature but won't be to hot for the dog.
27586	10	1	1	light gray :: i think light gray would work the best becaus e,if its hot outside the house will manage to stay cool inside,and in the winter it will manage to stay warm inside.
